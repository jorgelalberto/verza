PRESENTATION

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the Verizon first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded.
If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mike Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

Mike Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP, IR

Thanks, Tori. Good morning and welcome to our first-quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I am here with our Chief Financial
Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on the
investor relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.

Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking
statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are
discussed in Verizon's filings with the SEC.

This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures can be found on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a
year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.

Before Fran goes through these results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $1.06 per share
on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I would like to highlight.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Our reported earnings include a non-cash pretax loss of $165 million for a pension mark-to-market adjustment due to settlement accounting. We
expect settlement accounting to impact earnings in each of the remaining quarters in 2016. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $142
million on a spectrum license transaction.

On an after-tax basis, the loss on settlement accounting amounted to $102 million, or $0.02 per share, and the gain on the spectrum transaction
amounted to $88 million, or $0.02 per share, effectively offsetting each other. Including the effect of these nonoperational items, earnings per
share of $1.06 in the first quarter compared to $1.02 per share a year ago for a growth rate of 3.9%. There were no special items of a nonoperational
nature in the first quarter of 2015.

As a reminder, our Wireline results for the first quarter included the operations from the three states that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016. As
we have done over the past year, we have recognized a full-quarter benefit of approximately $229 million pretax, or about $0.03 per share, due to
these assets being classified as held for sale. This compares to $146 million pretax benefit, or $0.02 per share, that we recognized in the first quarter
of 2015. Additionally, the operations of AOL are not included in prior-period results.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We remain confident in our three-tier strategy for long-term growth, which is to lead at the network
connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through the global platforms in video and Internet of Things, and create
incremental revenue opportunities in applications and content.

In terms of progress on this multi-tier strategy, we are focused on network leadership and operating efficiency while we develop new ecosystems
in video and the Internet of Things, leveraging our capabilities in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also developing a
portfolio of unique content targeted at the Millennial generation so that we can capitalize on the opportunity transforming mobile.

At the network connectivity layer, we consistently invest in our 4G LTE network to accommodate growth in data usage and enable customers to
experience an unmatched level of connectivity. National studies continue to recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader.
Having the best network does matter, as reflected in our strong customer retention that we will discuss later.

We are enhancing capacity and coverage by effectively managing our spectrum, further densifying areas of significant usage, and implementing
a number of optimization techniques such as carrier aggregation. Approximately 92% of our total data traffic is now on the LTE network. The
amount of data on the network increased at a rate of approximately 50% over the prior year.

Over the long term, densification of our Wireless network, particularly in urban and concentrated usage areas, is required to add capacity to manage
these growing consumption trends, as well as to pre-position ourselves for the 5G technology of the future.

A key element of this densification strategy is access to fiber. During the quarter we announced our intention to acquire XO Communications,
which will provide us the opportunity to deepen and expand our fiber assets nationwide, as well as to lease millimeter-wave spectrum for 5G
testing purposes with the option to buy.

We are also very excited about the announcement made last week to deploy a new fiber platform within the city of Boston that will support wireless
and wireline technologies to consumers and enterprises across the city in a network-efficient way. This approach gives us tremendous flexibility
to innovate, develop, and deliver services with a mix of technologies over the same fiber assets.

In terms of 5G, our technical testing is going well and there is a strong interest and commitment from members of the 5G Forum to prepare for
fixed wireless commercial pilots using the technology next year.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Improving our operating cost structure is a priority. We will continue work on our operating model and are confident that we can improve efficiencies
as we have done in the past. We remain focused on cost reductions throughout the entire business and are making progress in driving efficiencies,
reducing overhead costs, and streamlining support. We have several initiatives that already been taken and others that we plan to implement for
2016 and beyond.

In the fourth quarter 2015, we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster
and more efficiently. Additionally, we continue to look at opportunities across all lines of business. You are starting to see these benefits in the first
quarter.

Overall, consolidated headcount since the end of 2015 is down approximately 3% as we continue to increase the efficiency of our operations. We
expect to receive additional savings from a number of initiatives during the second half of 2016.

We continue to streamline business support functions, utilizing our Lean Six Sigma approach across the business to reduce redundancy, drive
consistency, and improve speed of delivery in the market. Across Wireless we have identified opportunities to gain further efficiencies within the
store operations, call-center operations, and supply chain processes by simplifying our execution model while improving the overall customer
experience.

Network-related opportunities exist for consolidation and elimination of unnecessary facilities to gain synergies and reduce costs. Always more
work to be done here, but we are pleased with the continued progress.

Our networks and operating model also enable us to grow and expand our revenue streams through new ecosystems, platforms, content, and
solution layers. We are enhancing our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution, and advertising
platforms across all screens.

The video platform continues to expand as we add more unique content that appeals to Millennial audiences, such as the partnership recently
announced with Hearst. Our joint venture with Hearst includes developing two initial channels of video programming targeting the digital Millennial
audience to be distributed across multiple distribution platforms. Additionally, we signed an agreement to acquire an equity stake in AwesomenessTV
and entered into an agreement to create new premium content service featuring short-form mobile content that will launch initially on go90.

Just over the last few days we announced the acquisition of a 50% ownership in Complex Media with Hearst. The investments in AwesomenessTV
and Complex Media position us as partial owners in the number one digital media brands for young Millennials.

On the go90 application, we remain encouraged by the viewership of go90, but as we have said before, we are still in the very early stages of gaining
traction and engagement. Verizon Wireless subscribers now have greater flexibility when streaming live sports, concerts, and original series content
within go90 on their mobile devices and can enjoy this content free of data charges with our FreeBee data service. We look forward to expanding
our go90 content to other media through our AOL brands and the web later this year.

Within the Internet of Things ecosystem, we continue to develop platforms and our network to take advantage of the opportunities to innovate
and offer solutions that address some of the more pressing social, economic, and business challenges. We have launched our own utility,
transportation, and healthcare solutions with products like Networkfleet, Grid Wide, Verizon Share, hum, and one of our newest products, Intelligent
Track and Trace.

Our ThingSpace platform is set to accelerate the adoption of Internet of Things products and solutions by making it easier, faster, and more accessible
to develop applications. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are going with revenues of approximately $195 million in the quarter,
a year-over-year increase of about 25%. While we build for the future, fundamental execution and quality financial results are a top priority.

Now let's get into the first-quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on slide 5.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Our first-quarter results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy in the current market. We delivered strong operating
and financial results by growing our quality customer base, expanding earnings, and generating solid free cash flow for the quarter.

Earnings per share grew 3.9% and free cash flow was $4 billion, which enables us to invest and return value to our shareholders. Total operating
revenue in the first quarter was $32.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. AOL had its best first-quarter revenues in the last five years, driven by growth in
the platform layer.

If we exclude AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top-line revenue declined by 1.5% for the quarter. This was due to lower Wireless
phone activations on the device installment sales, lower upgrades, and the continued migration of our customer base to unsubsidized pricing.

In Wireline, the higher growth of internet-only activations and smaller video bundles also pressured revenue growth. As we manage through the
revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments and develop new products and services, we remain focused on improving our overall
cost structure to maintain our strong earnings profile.

Consistent with the prior year, consolidated EBITDA totaled about $12 billion and our EBITDA margin was 37.2% in the quarter, which was driven
by our ability to manage cost and expand margin, even with the pressure on the top line.

Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 6.

Cash flows from operation totaled $7.4 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the cash received
from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015 that was allocated to cash flow from operations. We continued to sell device
installment receivables and received about $2 billion in gross cash proceeds from new transactions in the first quarter. We believe that the underlying
quality of our device installment receivables has been instrumental in helping this securitization program be so successful. Free cash flow for the
quarter totaled $4 billion.

We continue to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in the
first quarter, which included approximately $150 million related to the markets that were sold to Frontier. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.2
billion in the quarter, down about 9.5% from a year ago, which was the result of the timing of investments. We fully anticipate capital spending for
the year to be within our guided range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.

Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $109.9 billion of total debt, net
debt of $104 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2 times.

We completed the sale of properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016. The pretax proceeds from the sale were used to repay outstanding debt in the
current quarter. In early April we already executed tender offers and early redemptions to repay over $10 billion in debt to reduce our total debt
balance.

Now let's move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on slide 7.

In Wireless, we posted a balanced quarter of quality connections growth and margin expansion. Postpaid net adds totaled $640,000 in a seasonally
low volume quarter, excluding all wholesale connections including IoT. Net phone additions were negative 8,000 for the quarter as compared to
a negative 138,000 a year ago, a significant improvement over the prior year, driven by customer retention.

Retail postpaid churn was 0.96%, down 7 basis points for the quarter and sequentially consistent. We have taken many actions to improve and
simplify our customer experience and provide the best network, which have resulted in improved customer loyalty and satisfaction. We ended the
quarter with 112.6 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections.

Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.4% to 107.2 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Postpaid gross additions
were 3.7 million, consistent with the prior year. The majority of gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

The composition of our 640,000 postpaid net adds was very strong. Within the postpaid net adds we added 452,000 new 4G smartphones in the
quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 284,000 net new smartphones. The remainder of the offset in
phone net adds were basic devices.

Tablet net adds totaled 507,000. Other connected devices of 176,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices
being a large contributor. We are beginning to see traction and increasing demand for the hum product which we introduced last year. Net prepaid
devices declined by 177,000.

Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on slide 8.

Total postpaid device activations totaled 9.9 million in the quarter, down about 3.9%. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with
tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 73.8 million smartphones in total and our smartphone
penetration increased to 85% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 81% of our retail postpaid connections base.

As expected, seasonality and lower customer demand for new devices contributed to the softer volumes of upgrades in the first quarter. About
5.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter, which represents a decline from the prior year of 70 basis points.

Now let's review Wireless profitability and revenue on slide 9.

In the Wireless segment, profitability and cash flows were driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. In terms of profitability, we
generated $10.2 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 1.7%, and had an EBITDA margin of 46.2%, an increase of 140 basis points.

Total Wireless operating revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter to $22 billion. Service revenue of $16.8 billion declined 6.2% for the quarter as a
result of the continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. Equipment revenue increased to approximately $4 billion, up 17.2% for the first quarter.

Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.6% in the first quarter. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured
as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device
payment plans increases. Overall, about 48% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing plan.

As we discussed previously, we believe service revenue will flatten its decline midyear when the base of our customers on the unsubsidized pricing
plans exceeds 50%. Over the course of the next year we expect the decline in service revenue will slow, ultimately turning positive by the end of
2017.

The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to about 68% in the first quarter, compared with about 67% in the fourth
quarter. The first-quarter take rate fell below our expectation of more than 70% due to customer preference, especially on upgrades, which
contributed to lower equipment revenue growth. We expect the second-quarter take rate for device installment plans to be around 70%.

During the quarter, 5.5 million phones were activated on a device installment payment plan. We have about 28.8 million device installment phone
connections in total, representing 33% of our postpaid phone base.

Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide 10.

In the consumer business, FiOS remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents about 81% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter,
consumer revenue grew 0.8%. Mass markets, which include small business, was consistent with the prior year. During the quarter, FiOS total revenue
grew 5% with consumer FiOS revenue growing at 4.7%.

The increased penetration of Quantum and the desire for higher data speeds are the primary drivers of the FiOS growth. At the end of the quarter,
about 78% of our consumer FiOS internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. Additionally, the increasing

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

number of customers opting for higher speeds is evident as about 60% of our consumer FiOS internet sales are opting for speeds at 100 megabits
and above.

FiOS internet subscriber growth remained strong in the first quarter. In broadband we added 98,000 net FiOS customers for the quarter, which was
consistent with the fourth quarter. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 10,000 in the quarter.

In FiOS video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which improved from 20,000 net customers in the fourth quarter. The consumer
revenue growth trajectory continued to decline as customers downsized their existing bundles and core voice services are no longer desired.

We introduced the next generation of our custom TV offering during the quarter, expanding the content and value provided by the original custom
TV offer to appeal to an even wider range of value-conscious customers. Customers now have a choice between selecting an essentials plan and
a sports and more plan, with the options to select up to three additional packs.

The demand for custom TV remains strong and, during the first quarter, custom TV represented about 38% of our FiOS video sales. Due to the low
price of the bundle and the lower content costs associated with the custom TV, a custom TV customer generates less revenue, but contributes
more margin than the traditional FiOS video customer.

Let's turn to slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total.

The segment EBITDA margin was 23.4% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year due to strong cost control. Total operating revenues
for the entire Wireline segment declined 1.9% in the quarter.

In the enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization in the rate of decline on a constant currency basis.
In the first quarter global enterprise revenue declined 3.1%. On a constant currency basis, it was down about 2.6%. In our global wholesale business,
revenues declined 4% in the first quarter. Trends for both enterprise and global wholesale remain consistent with 2015 results.

Let's move next to slide 12 for an overview of the Wireline segment post the Frontier transaction.

Now that we have completed the sale of our Florida, Texas, and California properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016, the historical results associated
with these three markets will be included in Corporate and Other, beginning with the second-quarter results. For illustrative purposes, on a
preliminary basis, we have shown fiscal year 2014 and 2015 and first-quarter 2015 and 2016 recast results. We will also provide nine quarters of
recast financials for the Wireline segment, excluding the three markets, later in the second quarter.

Recast total revenue for the first quarter 2016, excluding these three markets, was approximately $8 billion, which is comparable to the prior year.
As previously stated, we think we have tremendous opportunity to further penetrate the remaining properties from Massachusetts to Virginia with
our fiber infrastructure and FiOS products. Recast Wireline margin, excluding these markets, decreased as expected, since these properties were
more profitable than the properties that remained. Without these properties, the Wireline EBITDA margin for the first quarter was approximately
19%.

We have been working on our post-Frontier-transaction cost structure as part of our overall cost initiatives outlined earlier. As we have stated
before, we are committed to offset the financial impact of this transaction, including the stranded cost at the consolidated level. Our efforts in this
area can be seen in the fact that the recast Wireline margin expanded by approximately 200 basis points from the first quarter 2015 to first quarter
2016. We recognize that some of the efficiencies and future savings we need in order to offset the impact this year are dependent on the timing
and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.

Let's move next to slide 13 for an overview of our liability management.

Subsequent to the Vodafone transaction and at year-end 2014, total debt was approximately $113 billion and at the end of the first quarter 2016
our total debt was approximately $110 billion. We have been actively managing our debt portfolio entering into the second quarter of 2016.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

In early April 2016 we utilized Frontier proceeds, plus cash on hand, to complete tender offers and early redemptions of $10.7 billion of face value
debt with a cash outlay of $12.5 billion. Our strategy focused on retiring higher-cost debt with a range of maturities through 2043, thereby improving
our maturity profile and achieving lower borrowing costs for the future. The Frontier-related tax obligations, which are payable in the second half
of 2016, and our remaining debt maturity of $2.3 billion in September are both very manageable within our 2016 funding plan.

Through our liability management efforts and our future funding plans, we are on track to return to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit-rating
profile by 2018/2019 timeframe. At the same time, we are continuing to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with a priority to invest for
the future. Since the Vodafone transaction closed, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, invested in new businesses, improved our debt
profile, and returned value to our shareholders, both through an accelerated share repurchase program and through a dividend increase each
year.

Let's move next to slide 14 for our summary and 2016 priorities.

We are off to a strong start in 2016 as we executed on the fundamentals of the business: growing high value customers, delivering strong financial
and operating results, and generating free cash flows. Our results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete in a competitive environment,
while effectively implementing our strategies. We remain focused on enhancing our networks and platforms to position us for future growth and
on further developing new ecosystems.

At the operational level, we are navigating through the transition to the device installment payment model, stabilizing the trend in Wireline
revenues, improving our overall cost structure, and ramping new revenue streams.

At this point in the year we continue to expect full-year 2016 adjusted earnings to be a level comparable to our strong full-year 2015 adjusted
earnings. However, given the status of our labor contract negotiations, there will be pressure on earnings in the second quarter due to the timing
of cost reductions. Depending on the progress of the negotiations, we may need to update the full-year guidance at a later time.

With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.

Mike Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP, IR

Fran, thank you. Tori, we're ready to open it up for questions, so if we can take the first question, please.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Thanks and appreciate the color. I didn't catch it in the release; are you guys still reporting postpaid ARPA? And if so, could you break it out for us?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Sure. We are going to continue to report the postpaid I-ARPA, but, Brett, we will get that out to everybody so that you can see that.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Okay. Then just a separate question. You noted that you are going to be making this investment in Boston. I was hoping you could give us some
thoughts around the timing of that so we could think about how that might flow through into CapEx.

And then are you thinking that there could be an opportunity to continue to expand your fiber presence, particularly as you think about densifying
your wireless network? Thanks.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Sure, Brett, thanks. Boston is a unique situation. We announced the intent to expand FiOS in Boston; understand that the LFA has to be negotiated
with city council and that is a public process that will take approximately six months. We have been in discussions with some broad framework,
but we need to go through that process.

It's also important to note that the LFA is only for video linear TV services. It is not required for broadband or 5G, so obviously when we looked at
Boston it was a city that we needed to densify for the LTE network. So as we looked at all of our current COs around the footprint and the fiber that
we already had there, it kind of was a no-brainer to us to say we can do the fiber build out to expand the LTE densification, but we also can use this
opportunity, with only an increment of about $300 million over the next five to six years, to expand our FiOS footprint.

The $300 million you're not even going to see it in the Wireline capital numbers; it's already there. And as far as the capital that was going to be
incurred on the Wireless side of the house, that was already going to be spent regardless of whether we expanded FiOS. So we will get to this, but
we are starting to -- we will start this midyear this year for especially the 5G and 4G LTE densification. We will start the internet capability with
passing homes, but for the video product we will have to wait to go through the LFA city council process.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Is this the last significant fiber deployment you would expect to make within your remaining footprint? Or do you think that there is an opportunity
to keep doing this in the Northeast?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

I think what we will have to do, Brett, is we will take one city at a time. Obviously we still don't have Alexandria built out or Baltimore, so if we get
to a position where we believe we are going to need to invest in densification in those cities, then that's an opportunity for us to take a look at it.
But at this time we are concentrating on Boston.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Thanks for taking the question.

Operator

Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Thanks a lot. Good morning, Fran. Can you just provide a little bit more clarity about your comments on Q2 and the rest of the year? Is it reasonable
to take the Q1 margins, the recast margins in Wireline, that you provided as a good guidepost here until you get more cost savings coming through?

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Maybe you can just reflect on any particular puts and takes from the strike in terms of extra costs from additional labor you might need to hire or
conversely some cost savings. What are you seeing so far in terms of impact on the business in terms of broadband adds, trouble reports, etc.?

Then if you have any update on your data center evaluation, the sale process, thanks.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Sure. Thanks, Simon. On guidance, first and foremost, we are absolutely confident at this point in time, based on everything that we have planned
and the timing of the union contract, that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last year. Just to set the record here, again we did not give
revenue guidance; we gave EBITDA margin percent guidance and we gave EPS guidance that would be relatively comparable to 2015.

So if you step back a second and look at earnings per share at 2015 coming in at $3.99, we have to keep in mind that $0.13 of that was from our
assets held for sale, so really the comparable number is $3.86. As we said, we felt good about growing earnings back to that $3.99 through our
normal operation results of the business.

So if you take that first quarter and move it forward for the first quarter $1.06, so that would mean we are $0.04 ahead of the prior year. That $0.04,
which is somewhat attributed to the Frontier properties for the full quarter, will reverse in the second quarter. If you start out your baseline from
last year's reported EPS of $1.04, $0.04 is taken right off the top for that.

And then as we talked, there is going to be some timing on offsetting the stranded costs. Again I want to reiterate that we have always said that
the stranded costs would be offset on a consolidated basis, not within total Wireline segment. So we do have some timing here.

We are looking at business transformation activities. If you look at the Verizon Wireless restructure, that was part of the overall plan to contribute
and offset some of the stranded costs. So you can see we're already looking at operational efficiencies on a consolidated basis.

But other things that we are looking at is around distribution centers and call centers. As you know, call centers are a very high turnover rate for
employees and with our decrease in calls coming in from our Wireless customers because of more online, more chat, more self-service, we will not
hire as many customer call centers and we will achieve this through our attrition rates just naturally within the call center. So there's opportunity
to reduce force just through the attrition rate.

Then if you look at our equipment volumes, since the equipment logistics system in Wireless is mostly a variable cost system, as we look to the
future and the upgrade volume, which we assume will be lower, there's going to be some cost efficiencies that we gain there. So as we look at this
there will be some timing. Q2 will be lower than just the $0.04, but we're looking at we will regain that in the back half of the year with some of the
other things we're doing.

Now finally, obviously on this, the timing of the union agreement, we had planned for that. And if it goes longer, then we would come back in
mid-year. But keep in mind that we're looking at this as a long-term agreement for both providing quality jobs for our employees and returning
shareholder value to our shareholders. So that's where we stand with guidance. Hopefully, that clears it up a little bit.

On the second question or the second part of your question around the strike, at this point it's too early to tell the impacts. We've deployed
thousands of management employees to take on the work. We obviously always during this period of time fall a little bit behind on the install work.
We still see good momentum coming in from a sales perspective, so there's a little bit of a backlog there, and we will just have to work through
this.

But right now really no financial impact, per se, in the second quarter that I'm anticipating, unless this drags on for a much longer period of time.

On the data center sale, look, this is still I would consider it exploratory. There's a lot of activity going on, but nothing at this point that I'm prepared
to announce in a public forum. But we continue to explore that activity.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Very helpful, thanks.

Operator

David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. I guess two, if I could.

First one, Fran, just following up on that guidance question. You highlight that if you hadn't had the Frontier benefit last year the earnings would've
been more like $3.86. But if I do the math on the impact that Frontier is having on 2016, if you hadn't sold the Frontier asset the earnings would
be reasonably materially higher.

And my math is that the year-over-year earnings power of Verizon, had the Frontier assets not been part of the mix here, would've been about
10%. And Street estimates are really only looking for about 3% earnings growth next year. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on what
you see as the underlying earnings power of the Verizon business as we think about next year's growth, ignoring the strike issues for a second.

Then just the second question, if I could, would be on upgrade rate. I didn't see it in the notes yet for this quarter, but obviously reports are that
it's been lower than normal. I was wondering if you could kind of talk about how you see the cadence or the shape of the year with the iPhone 7
likely coming out in the back part of the year and the amount of upgrades you would see by that point in time, thanks.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, David. On earnings, look, we've been pretty open about 2016 and of course we've got a lot of things going in a lot of different directions.
Obviously, if you look at it, even with Verizon Wireless and the headwind of the revenue here and the transformation of the pricing model, we're
still increasing the profitability of that business. It's really the recurring revenue that we are focused in on and the quality of our customers.

On the Wireline side of house, again you see there is pressure on top line because of custom TV and internet-only now versus triple-play. But again,
we're improving the profitability of that business. So for this year we will stick with what we talked about on guidance.

Mike and I have been pretty open and Lowell has been pretty open about 2017. We believe we will get back to a normal growth rate in 2017, but
I would not attribute it to anything that we divested or acquired. There's a lot of moving parts here, especially within the strategic portfolio, that's
putting pressure on some of the bottom line, so I would not overindulge on the Frontier divestiture.

I mean we've got a really good value for that that we're going to put the cash to work that really benefits the earnings power of this company. And
that's the way I look at it.

On the upgrade rate, look, if you look at year over year we're down over 400,000 units on an upgrade rate and obviously that had a lot of impact
on the equipment revenue side. But the other thing that we are seeing is our embedded-base customers are selecting the subsidy model on an
upgrade basis, which is why the overall device installment plan take rate did not meet our expectation for the quarter of 70% and fell short to 68%.

If you look at that, David, and look back to the earnings power, you would think that the stronger uptake in device installment plan would drive
more margin, but in fact, we missed that metric. We did lower and we actually improved our margin overall at Wireless. So there is a lot of moving
parts here.

But to your question of where do I think upgrade rates are going to go, at this point, based on what we know, we think that upgrade rates will be
relatively the same as 2015. I can't talk to the fourth quarter yet, because I just don't know what the devices are going to look like in our lineup at
this point in time.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Great. Thanks, Fran.

Phil Cusick, JPMorgan.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Thanks. Two quick ones, if I can. One, can you comment on the FCC special access reforms? How are you thinking about that? Then two, the potential
to borrow against handset receivables; what do you think is the cost in that market, Fran, versus the normal bond market?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Phil. On the FCC special access, look, the FCC will take action this month sometime on special access rulemaking and its tariff investigation
into certain discounts that we and other large legacy providers offer for DS1s and 3s.

We have reached out -- we reached a deal with a lot of the CLECs in order to resolve a long-standing and contentious regulatory issue here. Our
top priority, though, is to ensure that our business services are a level playing field with all the other competitors including cable companies. We
intend to work with the industry and the FCC to develop a framework for that that applies to all competitors equally and relies on the sound public
policy to determine where and when regulation is appropriate.

So we will wait to see what the FCC does here, Phil, and then we will respond accordingly.

On the bond market and the recent press reports coming out of Bloomberg, look, we have been pretty open and public that we have been looking
at an alternative financing arrangement for our installment sale receivables. The public asset-backed market is an alternative that we've explored.
We've had a number of discussions.

We are having discussions continuing with alternative providers and various parties, but at this point in time these are just discussions. It's something
we're looking at. We're still doing a lot of analysis around it and at this point it's just something that we continue to look at. Nothing to announce
here today that we're going to change anything at this point in time.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

All right, thanks, Fran.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Mike Rollins - Citigroup - Analyst

Thanks, two if I could. First, as you look at the range of possible investments that you can make over the next 12 or 24 months, is there a balance
sheet debt level that investors should be keeping in mind in dollars or ratio terms, the upper threshold for what the Company is comfortable with?

Then secondly, as you look specifically at the performance of AOL since you purchased the asset, are there some examples that you could provide
on ways in which Verizon has made the performance of that asset better in terms of revenue or cash flow? And how some of the recent content
investments might further the performance of that asset? Thanks.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. On the investment side, look, we've been pretty open that our main priority is to get our debt level back to an A- rated company and
we are on track to do that. Everything we do that continues to be the top priority.

So even with all of the M&A activity you've seen, if you look back, we started this on a post-Vodafone debt of $113 billion. We've reduced that to
$109 billion. But keep in mind that with a $10.4 billion spectrum purchase during that period of time.

That was with $4 billion of purchase of AOL and some miscellaneous tuck-ins, capital investment, share repurchase, and now we have just sold the
Frontier properties that helps bring that debt down even to a lower level. So we are right on course. But that is top of mind at everything that we
do and will continue to be a commitment that Lowell and I made that is forefront that we will commit to.

On the AOL performance, look, I think -- I'm not going to get into a lot of details on AOL, but, look, they've had the best quarter in revenue in the
last five years. If you go back to the fourth quarter, we said they were up $300 million year over year. Now, of course, that's seasonal, but that shows
you though that the investments that we've made in the platforms, a lot of the tuck-in type investments that we made with acquisitions -- and
these are small acquisitions, but they are real critical.

If you just look at the most recent acquisition we just did with RYOT, this is a real, unique 360-degree video production. It is for really Huff Post for
them to increase their viability on producing videos for news, but again, this goes to our strategy in attacking a certain population that, quite
honestly, Verizon is underpenetrated in. If you look at that acquisition, it directly goes to Gen Z; 73% of their audience is Millennials. So these are
real strategic for us to improve the viability of that platform.

The other thing you are going to see us do this year is around go90. The go90 product will start to cross all of the AOL platforms this year. That is
going to enhance both the AOL platforms and it's also going to enhance the go90 platform.

Continuing with our strategy we will -- as I said before, we will open the box at some point in time to give you more visibility to this. And I continue
to say that that will be midyear to maybe third quarter of this year where we will start to produce some numbers around some of these more
specific platforms that we talk about.

Mike Rollins - Citigroup - Analyst

Fran, is there a ratio or set of numbers you could put around how you perceive getting to that A- debt level? Are there indications that you've
received for that?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Sure. If you look at each of the rating agencies, each of the rating agencies have a different approach because some of them include the pension
plan unfunded liability. Others include the OPEB unfunded liability. Others don't include any of that. Securitizations, some include, some don't.

So each of them is a different metric, but if you look at our overall GAAP ratio, it kind of follows in task with what we would need to be. And based
on the GAAP ratio, you should look at 2.0 to 2.1 type area in order to achieve that A- rating.

Mike Rollins - Citigroup - Analyst

Thank you very much.

Operator

Craig Moffett, MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson - Analyst

Good morning. Let me see if I can tie together maybe a question about the FCC and the ongoing discussions about Yahoo. Given that in the FCC
right now you've got the privacy NPRM and you've got some uncertainty around whether wireless is or isn't going to be upheld under Title II, how
does that inform the way you think about what you might be able to do with AOL directly I guess and also trying to expand the platform of
advertising as you might do with Yahoo, if you're the acquirer?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Craig. Look, I'm not going to speak anything to deal with Yahoo, so let's just talk about what we have on the table today.

Under the sponsor data zero-rating type issue, the net neutrality already advocates some of this. We have structured our sponsored data program
to comply with all the FCC net neutrality rules. For example, if any party, third-party is interested in that, we will offer that on a nondiscriminatory
basis and we've priced it accordingly at a commercially favorable rate that we believe is in direct really compliance with the FCC net neutrality rule.

We think that sponsored data and other freebie data programs are good for the consumer and that regulators will recognize that after concluding
their review on our products. So based on the zero data, we will have to wait and see where they come out on that.

As far as Title II goes, look, we agree with the principles with net neutrality rules. The thing that we disagreed with and opposed was applying Title
II broadband services and particularly wireless broadband. So we will have to see where this comes out, but reclassing broadband under Title II
was not necessary to ensure an open internet. There's been nothing ever that shows that it has not been an open internet.

This will, obviously, have some negative consequences on innovation as a whole. But, look, we are a company that has operated under regulation
for 100 years and has been very successful, so we will wait and see what the FCC concludes and then we will operate accordingly. But it's too early
to say what exactly is going to happen here.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson - Analyst

Fran, does the specific limitations that might or might not be imposed on the use of customer data under the privacy NPRM that stems from
reclassification, does that impact your ability to monetize an asset like Yahoo or AOL in general to -- as you think about how you would use that
for advertising purposes?

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Look, we at Verizon -- privacy and security has always been top of mind. Normally, we always use an opt-in with our customers or some type of an
opt-out feature.

The issue though that we have right now is under the FCC proposed aggressive rules on privacy and data security, that would apply to broadband
providers but not companies like Google and Facebook. So if we're going to have rules, we need to make sure we don't single out certain industries
to either benefit or not benefit from those rules. And that's something that our legal department continues to work with the FCC on, so we will see
where this ultimately comes out. But that's really the crux of the issue for us.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson - Analyst

Thanks, Fran.

Operator

John Hodulik, UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Thanks. Fran, maybe you could comment on the competitive environment you are seeing in the Wireless. You guys were able to cut your postpaid
handset losses on a year-over-year basis pretty meaningfully. Do you expect that to continue through the year?

Then secondly, prepaid has always been an area where you guys haven't really focused. You continue to lose subs in that space. Meanwhile, I think
AT&T and T-Mobile are seeing a lot of growth in that area. Maybe you could compare your views on that market and why you guys don't see that
as a source for growth, thanks.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Sure. Thanks, John. On the competitive environment of Verizon, look, coming into 2015 and again in 2016 we said that the top priority would be
to maintain the high quality of base. And you see us doing that. We now have 48% of our base over on the new pricing and we continue to push
for that.

You saw this 7 basis point decrease in churn for the last couple of quarters. What I would say though is, if you look ahead, last year's second quarter
the churn was like at 0.90. I would not anticipate, nor should you anticipate, that we will achieve that churn rate again because things have kind
of flattened out now. I would look at the first quarter as a guide to where we will be for the rest of the year from a churn perspective.

Part of that is because we are seeing some increased churn on tablets, which we have talked about before, where we gave a free tablet away and
we saw that the customer base just didn't see the value of that tablet when it was free. They signed up for the two-year agreement because they
got a tablet for $10 a month, so $240, and they disconnected it at the end of the agreement. We stopped doing that promotion for that reason,
but you see some of these tablets now coming up on the two-year deal. We anticipate that some of that higher churn in that tablet environment
will hit us over the next couple of quarters, so we should be prepared for that.

But as far as the smartphone churn, we are continuing to see improvement in that smartphone churn, which gets us to holding a flat churn rate
overall. So I think that is really what's important to us right now is that smartphone churn rate, which is really where we are dedicating all of our
concentration and our promos.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

On the prepaid side, absolutely. Our retail prepaid is above market. We're really not competitive in that environment for a whole host of reasons
and it's because we have to make sure that we don't migrate our high-quality postpaid base over to a prepaid product.

If you look at the competitive nature, they are doing it with sub brands. They are not really doing it with their brands. And quite honestly, we use
the Tracfone brand as our prepaid product.

Tracfone has been extremely successful for us. It's not something that we disclose any more on reseller, but it continues to increase on the high-quality
base of Tracfone, so that's really where we use and go after the prepaid market. More to come on this during the year, but currently that's how we
operate under the prepaid model.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Okay. Thanks, Fran.

Operator

Mike McCormack, Jefferies.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies - Analyst

Fran, thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on what your view is, maybe more holistically, on the video landscape. What other assets do you think
Verizon requires? I'm thinking about FiOS video long term; where does that go?

Then I guess on the service revenue stabilization, that 50% benchmark, what kind of factors have you built into that to get to that expectation?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. On the video landscape, look, I think we've set the bar on where we're going on video, both in the home and outside the home. In
the home, we were the first to come out with our custom TV package which rebundled certain content, and it's been very successful. This quarter,
even with the rebundle of custom TV, we had a 38% take rate on that bundle.

What I will tell you is, yes, it does give us some top-line pressure because it's a lower bundle from a revenue perspective, but the content cost is
considerably lower. Therefore, it generates actually more margin for us.

It's the right thing to do. This is what customers want. They don't want to pay for 300 channels anymore and only watch 17 on average. We're trying
to give customers what they want and that's a fight obviously with all the content providers, but we are doing it within the legality of our contracts.
Of course, we won't breach any of our contracts, but it's the way that the environment is moving. So I don't think we're going to change any
approach to our in-home delivery.

The other thing is there's confusion out there on the video side, which is everybody wants to talk about taking in-home video to a mobile handset
and this is something new. This has been done for the last two years. Everybody who has an in-home subscriber, most rights give them the ability
to view that content as long as they subscribe and authenticate to that subscription. They can watch that on their mobile handset.

We are taking really the strategy in a whole different mode. We're going to a mobile-first strategy outside the home. It has nothing to do with
in-home content.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Now, some of the content you could watch at home could be on this, like sports. That has been very popular in the go90 environment, but we are
looking at a lot of different mobile-first, short clips, news, sports, and if you think about it, original content. If you look at the strategy that we have
taken in the last couple of quarters, we have added a lot of content that has nothing to do with in-home.

If you look at our Hearst joint venture, we now have joined in with them to create two very exclusive channels for us: one is called RatedRed, one
is called Seriously.TV. And the target population is 12 to 24 years old.

We then -- as I said in my preambled remarks, AwesomenessTV we took a 25% ownership stake because what we saw was there was certain original
content that we had contracted with them that they deployed in go90 and we saw viewership really jump when those original contents presented
themselves. So this is another one where number one digital brand within the female population of ages 12 to 24; 160 million views, up 53% year
over year.

And then finally, if you look at what we just did within the last few days, entering into another joint venture with Hearst and buying Complex, 50%
owner. This is another number one digital brand in the male population of 18 to 24. Monthly unique viewers of 54 million and over 300 million
views per month.

So this is really where we are taking the video product on mobile, which is very different than what everyone else is talking about. We believe that's
where we are going to be a differentiated brand with go90 and AOL and everything else that we are doing around that video platform. So that's
kind of where we're at on that.

On the service revenue stability, look, Mike, we've done a lot of modeling. We consistently say as soon as we get to a more than 50% penetration
of that base on what I will call the device installment pricing plans, we start to see service revenue flatten out and we start to see accretion at the
back end of 2017. We have run a number of models and we consistently see that model towards that end. So that's really where we are at at this
point in time.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thank you very much and good morning, folks. I was wondering if we could discuss your network plans, Fran.

In the near term, as you mentioned, your CapEx was down high single digits during the quarter, but you remained fully committed towards your
guidance levels. What initiatives are top of mind for what seems to be an implied improving spending trajectory through the year?

And I guess longer term I was wondering if you could briefly discuss some of your initiatives on 5G. You folks clearly seem to be pushing a timeline
that is well ahead of your domestic peers and most of the global players as well.

APRIL 21, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

What is the impetus for this focus and where would be the time when you expect? What type of assets do you think you need to ensure to be able
to get to meet those expectations? Should we expect additional deals like XO or some organic investments in fiber, anything along those lines?
Thank you.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Amir. First, on just the CapEx; look, there's some timing here and the reason that is because, if you look at it, in the fourth quarter of last
year we really accelerated our spend really in Wireless to prepare for the Super Bowl. And that was a whole densification project on the West Coast
around San Francisco and Santa Clara. So really what you are seeing here is a timing issue.

We are right on track with our plans on densification. We are still deploying a lot of small cells, so there is nothing that I'm going to say here that
should concern you about our plans. You will see us catch up on that spend in the second and through the third and the fourth quarter, so coming
in right on guidance.

Now the only thing I will say here is keep in mind that the first quarter also had $150 million on Frontier that will disappear in the second quarter.
So you could assume that second quarter may be a little lighter than in the past, but again right on track with where we thought we would be.

On the 5G question, look, we are committed to being the first US company to rollout 5G wireless technology. We are currently what I would call
doing sandbox; sandbox as in creating innovation centers. We are working with the 5G Technology Forum, which includes all the major OEMs and
handset OEMs.

We will evolve this 5G ecosystem rapidly, just like we did with LTE, to ensure an aggressive pace of innovation. Currently, we're testing 5G technologies
this year and we aim to have an initial fixed wireless pilot starting in 2017. I want to reiterate that: this is a fixed wireless, which is really one of the
first cases that we see. It's really not about mobile. It's really around fixed wireless.

We're helping the industry to adopt the rules on 5G deployment, including the opening of the spectrum bands above the 24 gigahertz. And we
are working with the FCC. As you know, with XO we have the ability for an option to buy around the 28 gigahertz, which is currently how we're
doing our testing right now.

Then keep in mind that 5G is not a replacement technology of 4G, so this is not a capital-intensive overlay to the 4G network. It really is all about
high-speed video delivery over a wireless network in a very, very efficient way. You should think about 5G, again like we did with LTE, where you
see those 4 to 5 incremental cost decreases when delivering that video. That's similar to what we will see in the 5G environment.

So right now that's where we're at, but we continue to plow forward and we will be ready to go with the 5G technology.

Mike Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP, IR

Thank you. We will now turn the call back to Fran for some closing comments.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. Look, the first quarter provided strong results to the start of this year. Again, I want to reiterate: we are very confident in our ability
to execute on the fundamentals and grow this business profitably amidst the competitive environment and manage through the transition of our
business models.

We are also positioning our business for future profitable growth through cost and capital efficiency initiatives and all the new revenue streams
that we always talk about. We look forward to a positive 2016 with confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, create value for our customers,
our employees, and our shareholders.

APRIL 20, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Before Matt goes through the results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $0.84 per share on a
GAAP basis, which included about $0.02 of earnings pressure, primarily related to recent business acquisitions. These reported results include a
few nonoperational items that I would like to highlight.

Our reported first quarter earnings include a pretax early debt redemption charge of about $850 million and a noncash pretax gain on a spectrum
license transaction of roughly $125 million. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $435 million, or $0.11 per share. Excluding
the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.95 in the first quarter compared to $1.06 a year ago.

Recall that our first quarter 2016 adjusted EPS included $0.10 of earnings related to the 3 Wireline properties that we sold to Frontier. During the
first quarter, we reorganized the customer groups within the Wireline segment. On April 11, we released unaudited historical results recast for the
4 customer groups, including Verizon Business Markets, a new group that consist of U.S.-based small- and medium-sized businesses, state and
local governments and educational institutions. This new group was formed to increase the focus on these markets. The historical total segment
revenues remain unchanged from previously reported results. As a reminder, we are still subject to the FCC anti-collusion rules related to the
spectrum auction, so we'll not be able to answer spectrum-related questions.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today.

As outlined in our earnings call in January, our priorities for 2017 are to leverage our network leadership, retain and grow our high-quality customer
base while balancing profitability, enhance the ecosystems in media and telematics, and drive monetization of these networks and solutions. We
are executing against these priorities, while positioning the business for the long term as we progress through 2017.

The first quarter of 2017 proved to be a very active quarter for us. First, we extended our network leadership as recognized by third-party testing
results. Second, we launched an introductory unlimited wireless data plan to address evolving customer demand in a highly competitive environment.
Third, we realigned our operating teams to enable business agility to deliver new products and next-generation services.

Verizon's core strength and the foundation of our future success in a connected world starts with the network, and we have enhanced our track
record of U.S. industry leadership. We are consistently investing in our network to extend our leadership in both 4G and 5G. We also closed the
acquisition of XO Communications fiber assets in the quarter.

Our uncompromising commitment to our customers led to the launch of an introductory unlimited offering in the quarter. This measured approach
in a competitive and highly penetrated wireless phone environment was positively received by both the consumer market and, more importantly,
our existing customer base. Our competitive unlimited offer, coupled with network strength and reliability, allows us to attract, retain and grow
high-value customer relationships across our entire business.

At the end of the first quarter, we announced the realignment of our operating teams to facilitate organizational agility in wireless and fiber market,
to scale and expand our media and telematics businesses and to maintain leadership in network reliability and new technology. These changes
do not affect our segment reporting. We are confident in our strategy and priorities to provide the Best Network experience in the U.S., create
long-lasting customer relationships and identify growth opportunities in new businesses. Executing these strategies will enable us to continue to
deliver returns on our investments and drive long-term value for our shareholders.

Let's review the first quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by Wireless and Wireline results, media and telematics
progress and the network technology update.

Now on to Slide 6. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions in the period, consolidated revenue declined approximately
4.5%. The primary driver was the decrease in wireless service revenue resulting from the migration to the new pricing structures introduced over

the past 9 months and the ongoing transition of the base to unsubsidized pricing. These pricing moves have been positively received in the
marketplace. On a consolidated basis, excluding nonoperational items, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.3%, which was slightly higher
year-over-year due to steady improvement in operating efficiencies and cost management.

Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. We are generating substantial cash flows from our operating segments. Cash flow
from operations is $1.7 billion, which included discretionary pension contributions of $3.4 billion. Additionally, our ongoing asset-backed securitization
program provided $1.3 billion in the quarter, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The discretionary pension
contributions are net present value positive on an after-tax basis given the reduction in our variable-rate PBGC premiums and the expected net
return on planned assets. As a result of these contributions, our mandatory pension funding through 2020 is expected to be minimal, which will
benefit future cash flows and improve the funded status of our qualified pension plans. Also the rating agencies view debt-funded pension
contributions as neutral to credit rating metrics.

Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we are investing in our networks. Our capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the quarter, and we
expect capital spending for the year to be within our 2017 guided range.

Our balance sheet is strong and provides us the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $116.5 billion of total debt,
which was comprised of $110.2 billion of unsecured debt and $6.3 billion of on-balance-sheet securitizations.

During the quarter, we completed multiple capital market transactions, including new debt issuances to fund the discretionary pension contributions,
the acquisition of XO and to prefund the acquisition of Yahoo! These transactions included a $3.1 billion tender offer and a $9.0 billion debt
exchange, which reduced future cash interest costs and extended maturities. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile
by the 2018 to 2019 time frame.

Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments starting with Wireless and the impact of unlimited on Slide 8. In our Wireless business, we
have extended our network leadership position, while balancing operational performance in a competitive environment. Verizon is the U.S. market
leader across high-value postpaid phone customers, and we have consistently stated that our top priority is protecting our base to build on our
customer relationships into the future.

During the first quarter, we made a disciplined decision to launch an unlimited offering, so let's spend a few minutes on the factors leading to our
decision. As discussed on the last earnings call, we launched wireless plans in mid-2016 that offered safety mode and carryover data, reducing
overage charges. Since the launch, the U.S. wireless phone market experienced greater competition with unlimited plans from other carriers. We
chose to compete using equipment promotions during that time, while we evaluated different service pricing options, including unlimited. At the
start of 2017, competitive intensity escalated, resulting in loss of gross add share and an uptick in churn pressure, so we determined that the timing
was right for the introduction of an unlimited option at the high end of our existing plans.

We are confident in our network capability to efficiently manage the expected usage growth from unlimited because we have invested in technology,
architecture and densification. Our early network performance is consistent with our high quality of service expectations and within the current
network plan.

The customer response to the launch was favorable as evidenced by an immediate improvement in subscriber activity in the second half of the
quarter. In the quarter, in which we added 49,000 smartphones, our phone net adds had 2 distinct trajectories. Prior to an unlimited launch, we
had retail postpaid phone net losses of 398,000 customers. After the launch, we added 109,000 retail postpaid phone customers, which gives us
momentum entering the second quarter. Overall, in the first quarter, we lost 307,000 postpaid customers consisting of phone losses of 289,000
and tablet losses of 255,000, offset by other connected devices. We introduced the unlimited offering primarily to protect our high-quality base,
and we achieved the desired impact as retail phone churn improved after the launch and was less than 0.9% for the eighth consecutive quarter
despite heightened competition in the marketplace. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.15% increased year-over-year due to higher tablet churn,
which is expected to remain elevated throughout the year as customers roll off of free tablet promotions from prior years. Total postpaid device
activations were down almost 9% over the prior year, of which about 82% were phones. In a seasonally soft quarter, we had 5.2% of our retail
postpaid base upgrade to a new device, down from 5.8% last year.

APRIL 20, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

During the quarter, 5.7 million phones were activated on device payment plans. While we made progress in the prepaid market, this remains an
area of opportunity for us as prepaid devices declined by 17,000 in the quarter as compared to a decline of 177,000 in the prior year.

Let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 5.1% in the first quarter.
We experienced a change in the service revenue trend, which had been improving sequentially. Service revenue declined 6.1% year-over-year
compared to the 4.9% decrease in the previous quarter. The service revenue pressure was a result of decreased overage revenue, lower postpaid
customers in the quarter and promotional activity.

Overage pressure was primarily related to the ongoing migration to the pricing plans implemented last year and the introduction of unlimited
offerings. As expected, optimizers who benefit the most from stepping down in price, primarily single-line users, were the early adopters of these
plans.

We believe this revenue trend will persist through the first half of the year, but remain confident that these plans will be ARPA neutral over time,
as more users step up in price, which is already taking place. New customer accounts added after the unlimited launch on average had higher
account access fees. While we absorb overages in the near term, we expect that the increase in account access fees will replace overages over time.

Equipment revenue decreased 4.8% in the first quarter. Sequentially, the percentage of phone activations on device payment plan remained steady
at approximately 76% in the first quarter compared with about 77% in the fourth quarter. We expect the second quarter device payment plan take
rate to remain consistent. At the end of the quarter, approximately 48% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan, while about
71% were on unsubsidized pricing.

Our wireless EBITDA margin, as a percent of total revenue, was 45.1%, which was down due to the service revenue trend and the increased advertising
activity associated with the unlimited plan launch.

Let's move next to our Wireline segment on Slide 10. At the beginning of February, we completed the acquisition of XO Communications, which
contributed revenue to enterprise solutions, partner solutions and business markets for about 1/2 of the quarter. Excluding XO, Wireline segment
revenues maintained recent trends, declining 3.2%. Consumer markets revenue increased 0.7%, which was driven by favorable pricing, partially
offset by lower customer demand.

In FiOS Internet, we added 35,000 customers for the quarter. Over 22% of our broadband customers are on plans with speeds of 100 megabits per
second or more. FiOS Video losses of 13,000 in the quarter were indicative of softer demand for linear video due to the increase in over-the-top
offerings, mobile video consumption and competitive promotional offers, particularly in the New York market.

On an organic basis, enterprise solutions revenue declined 4.3% in the quarter as a result of pricing pressure in the market. On a constant currency
basis, this decline was 3.7%. The customer migration from legacy services, such as voice to advance communications products, is generating a
revenue headwind in the near term, while increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing serving cost over the long term.

Wireline segment EBITDA margin increased to 22.7% for the quarter, up from 19.0% last year. Tight cost controls, plus the impact of last year's
renegotiated labor contracts, improved profitability. We expect full year improvements in margins with seasonal fluctuations throughout the year.

Let's move next to Slide 11 to discuss our progress in new businesses. In our media business, AOL continues to deliver solid seasonal performance
with growth in gross revenue. Revenue, net of traffic acquisition costs, decreased about 4%, driven by a higher percentage of programmatic
advertising. Along with our content assets, AOL's ad-tech capabilities have enabled us to provide unique content across multiple platforms. We
have assembled video platforms to leverage the growing customer demand for digital media. Our targeted content pillars focusing on news, sports,
finance and lifestyle are already increasing in viewership. To provide the necessary scale to effectively leverage these assets, we are looking forward
to combining AOL and Yahoo! and operating the combined businesses under the Oath brand. We are actively working on integration streams with
Yahoo! to ensure a smooth consolidation when the transaction closes, which is expected during the second quarter.

APRIL 20, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Consistent with past quarters, digital video consumption on the go90 app maintained an average daily usage of about 30 minutes per viewer, with
less than 20% of the app traffic served on the Verizon Wireless network. During the quarter, the app was updated to improve the user interface,
increase content discovery and enhance the programming and advertising capabilities.

In the telematics business, we are quickly integrating the Fleetmatics and Telogis acquisitions. With these assets, we are the global market share
leader and are looking to expand our offerings in this space. Total telematics revenue was $214 million in the first quarter. Organically, IoT revenue,
including telematics, was up approximately 17% in the first quarter.

Let's move next to Slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our networks to ensure that overall quality and capacity
remains ahead of demand. Capital spending of $3.1 billion in the quarter was largely network-related to maintain leadership in our markets. Fiber
is a critical component of our network strategy and next-generation deployments as demonstrated by the success of our densification initiative.
Earlier this week, we announced a strategic agreement with Corning with whom we have a long relationship to supply optical fiber and hardware
solutions of at least $1.05 billion from 2018 to 2020. This investment ensures that we have adequate supply of fiber.

In the first quarter, LTE data traffic increased 57% over the prior year. While still early in the cycle, the increased data traffic resulting from unlimited
is in line with our expectations, and network management tools have been effective. We are committed to remaining the largest and most reliable
4G network through technological developments in LTE, deploying small cells and refarming mid-band spectrum. As part of the densification, we
are deepening our fiber assets, enhanced by the XO transaction. As previously announced, we are launching 11 pre-commercial 5G fixed wireless
pilots during the second quarter, and we look forward to sharing the results later in the year.

Let's move next to Slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. Our long-term growth model is to lead in network, expand our customer
relationships and develop new businesses in media and telematics. While executing on our strategy and positioning for future growth, in the
quarter, we listened to our customers, evaluated the marketplace and launched an unlimited offering in order to retain and grow our high-quality
customer relationships. We realigned our operating teams to increase business agility to deliver new products and next-generation services, and
develop new ecosystems in media and telematics in order to monetize the rising data traffic on our network. Overall, we are confident in our
strategy and ability to execute, and deliver long-term value to our customers, partners and shareholders.

With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you, Matt. Eunice, we're now ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

So Matt, you were talking about fiber and during his media appearances this week, Lowell noted that the company does, in fact, have a pretty
strong interest in adding more fiber to the network and even indicated that this could potentially be achieved through M&A. And when noting
that he said, "Yes, you know, there's never really a perfect fit in terms of architecture." And so my question is what type of architecture are you
looking to add to the network that you have today? And is it reasonable to assume that the choice you have to make is to either do this organically
through higher levels of capital investment or to do it inorganically through acquisitions, which could potentially result in the company operating
at higher leverage for longer than we had expected?

APRIL 20, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks, Brett. Yes, so I think if you look at what Lowell said earlier in the week, as we look at the network -- and it's consistent with what we've been
saying for over a year since we announced the fiber initiative in Boston, that as we look at the networks of the future, they're going to be built with
a lot of fiber deep into the network and that network is going to be built for multiuse cases, not for a single-use case. So it's going to deliver consumer
to the home applications, it's going to deliver small business applications, it's going to light up enterprise buildings and it's also going to deliver
smart cities and IoT solutions, too. So as we think about how you build that network out, you're going to need fiber that's not out there today,
which is one of the reasons we had the announcement earlier this week to make sure that we have access to the physical fiber as we start to deploy
it more in places like Boston around the country. Now as you say, the architecture doesn't exist today in terms of what we could acquire. So there's
options here. We can go out and we can build that fiber as we're doing in Boston. And we also look at every way that we get access to that fiber.
That's what it's critically about, it's getting access to the fiber we need to deliver the solutions that we're looking to do, and there's multiple ways
we can get there. So depending on the location, that may mean us building the fiber network. If there's great assets already in place and there's
the opportunity to acquire them at a good price, then we would certainly look to do that. And then there's also other ways to work with partners
through leasing and other arrangements, where we don't have to build or outright buy. So we look at all those opportunities as to how we get
access to that fiber that we need to build the network of the future and provide the solutions that our customers are going to want as we go
forward. So as you say, we could do that organically and inorganically. We're very comfortable and confident in the assets we have and adding on
to them ourselves. But if the right opportunity came along, we would look at that. And I think we've been fairly consistent about doing that. And
we've also been consistent about the impact on the balance sheet. We believe in a strong balance sheet. But if the right acquisition comes along
that allows us to add shareholder value in the long run, and it's the right thing for shareholders and all stakeholders in our business, we'd look at
doing that, but we'd do it in a way that certainly reflected the need to have a strong balance sheet.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

And just a quick follow-up. I mean, is it fair to assume that if the choice was to do it organically, it does require higher levels of capital investment?
Because if the answer is no, then I guess the follow-up to that one would be, what would ultimately make an acquisition attractive? Is it really just
speed to market?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes, there's a number of different aspects to it that would make it attractive, speed to market, the quality of the asset that's there, and we look at
all those things. But ultimately, if we have to build it ourselves, we're comfortable doing so. And we think we can do that relatively within our
investment plans.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup.

Mike Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD and U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Two, if I could. One, on the net add disclosure around the over 100,000 net adds since the launch of unlimited, given the seasonality that exists in
the first quarter, can you compare that to year-ago period and give us a sense of how net adds performed since unlimited relative to what it was
last year over the same time frame?

And then secondly, as you look at building small cells, I was wondering if you could put the fiber deal into context in terms of how many small cells
that could give Verizon. And then how long does it take to build that? I know it's a 3-year deal that got announced, but what's the pace that investors
should be thinking about in terms of how many small cells Verizon can deploy in a 12-month period?

APRIL 20, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. So Mike, thank you for the questions. So I'll start with your first one. We really don't break out the quarter typically in terms of the net add
numbers and so -- but when you look at year-over-year, what you're really looking at here is the impact of going to the unlimited and really giving
our customers the functionality that they're looking for. And that was a decision we made and you saw an immediate impact in our business. And
we certainly do look at the month-by-month. And I can tell you that this isn't a seasonality in the first quarter. The change we saw in the first quarter
between the 398,000 negative number through the first half and then the positive 109,000 in the second half was all about the response to unlimited
as opposed to any significant seasonality in the quarter. And then in terms of your second question on small cells, so the fiber deal isn't just about
building small cells. Obviously, we will build small cells with this, but there'll be other use cases as we go out. So we're not in a position today to
say the number of small cells that we will light up with this fiber agreement with Corning. I can tell you, we will continue to build the best-performing
wireless network across the country, and we'll use small cells. We'll use new technologies in LTE and moving into 5G to do that. And this fiber will
help us to do that.

Operator

Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group, and Telco and Pay TV
Analyst

Matt, just a couple of questions on sort of the financials. First, on the wireless side. Postpaid ARPA was down 5.8%, definitely a change in trend, as
you mentioned. Could you talk about the impact unlimited had? And the fact that it being -- that move happening mid-quarter, should we expect
that trend to worsen from here? Or do you think you've gotten most of the spin downs out of the way?

And then secondly, in terms of the guidance, you kept the guidance for the year that you had despite revenues being down, sort of 4.5% in earnings
being down about 10%. Can you talk a little bit about some of the sort of the drivers to getting back to sort of flat on both of those metrics for the
year?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. Thanks for the questions, John. So I'll start with your first one around wireless revenues and the ARPA decline. So as I look through the quarter
and see what happened in the wireless revenues, we have the continuation of the migration of the base to unsubsidized pricing. But in addition
to that, what we also saw was a reduction in overage revenues. And this really was as much about the continuation of people migrating to the
plans we launched last summer with safety mode and rollover data as it was about unlimited. We've seen a good amount of our base already roll
over to those plans, where the overage starts to decline. And as we go forward, we should expect to see that continue in the second quarter. And
then we expect we'll see the trend in wireless service revenue start to improve in the second half of the year. So we do think you'll see another
quarter of some pressure in wireless ARPA before we see it head up again. And look, the other piece it's in the wireless numbers is when we -- we
were down close to 400,000 net adds in the first part of the quarter, that's -- those were revenues that we didn't bill in the second half of the quarter.
But we saw the reversal in those trends and look forward to that piece continuing. So on the guide, if I go back to the guide real quickly, what we
said is on organic basis, we'll be fairly consistent. So when you look at the first quarter, a year ago it was $1.06 and that included about $0.10 from
the assets we sold to Frontier. This year, we had $0.95. And as Mike mentioned, there's about $0.02 of pressure in there from the acquisitions. So I
think we're in line there. From a revenue standpoint, they're down 4.5% on an organic basis year-over-year. As I said, the service revenue we expect
to improve in the trajectory in the second half of the year. The big thing around the revenue for the year is going to be equipment revenue. As
we've gone to the unsubsidized pricing, we recognize that equipment revenue at the time of the activation of the handset. We'll see what happens
in the back half of the year. We'll see the new devices that come to market. We'll see how the holiday season goes. And that will be a key driver of
getting to that revenue target.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

I wonder, Matt, if you could just talk a little bit more about capital spending for the year. You've obviously talked a lot about densification, so forth,
the range is quite wide? You reiterated that today. Your wireless was quite light this quarter. And so how should we think about mid-range, low
end, high end and the trajectory through the year?

And we were certainly getting a lot of questions about your Corning deal. $1 billion is a big contract. But I think Lowell was making the point that,
that's consistent with your overall capital spending needs. So is this something where it's consistent with the kind of spending you're expecting
or have been doing and continue to do? Or is this a real step-up in your fiber spending?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks, Simon. So on the last question, the Corning deal, so as you say, $1 billion over 3 years. It's certainly not a small number. But when you look
within the overall context of our capital spend, it certainly fits in there. So as we go and build out fiber assets, I think you'll see us do that within
our total capital spend. Yes, you will see us spend more on fiber as we go forward. But historically, you've seen moves within our capital spend
between different components. So this increase in the fiber spend will be offset by reductions in other areas, and that's the trend you've seen
consistently for us. In terms of capital spend for the year, the first quarter was certainly a lower quarter than we sometimes see. But the first quarter
is often a low capital spend quarter for us, so there's -- that's about where we expected it to come in. In terms of the guide for the year, it's too early
in the year to say exactly where we'll be in that range. I'm confident we'll be in that range. And as we go through the year, we'll provide more insight
into where we think we'll end up.

Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

I guess a couple, if I could. Just first one, could you be more specific with respect to exactly what XO Communications contributed in revenue in
EBITDA terms to the Wireline businesses for the 2 months that it did in the quarter?

And then also, Matt, it looks like taxes were actually a source of cash this quarter, but we are expecting cash tax outflows for the year. Could you
kind of elaborate a little bit on that?

And then I guess just lastly, just a housekeeping question. I guess, based on the comments you made about the kind of exit rate for subscriber
additions in 1Q, should we be extrapolating that kind of run rate performance into 2Q and the rest of the year?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. So on XO Communications, I would say you'd see nominal impact on the -- at the earnings level from that transaction in the course of the
quarter.

APRIL 20, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Your question around cash taxes, what you're seeing there is, as you say, it's -- the first quarter is typically light from a cash taxes standpoint just
because of the timing of when payments are due. As you go through the year, previously, we had said that cash taxes would converge closer with
the ETR rate. Because of some of the activity we had in the quarter with the discretionary pension contribution and the liability management
activity, cash taxes will now actually come in at a lower rate than the ETR for the year. So that's an improvement to the cash expectation for the
year.

From an exit rate of the first quarter, it's too soon to say just purely extrapolate that number out. But certainly, we're very confident that the offering
has resonated very strongly with the base, both in terms of improvements in churn and also an uptick in gross adds. We continue to see that. The
rest of the quarter will play out based off of new devices that hit the market and then also the competitive response, especially as we head into
Mother's Day and then the dad's and grads period in June. So -- but we do look forward to a better trajectory from the business with an offer out
there that is certainly resonating with customers.

Operator

Your next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

One sort of short one and maybe one longer. First, churn in handsets remains below 0.9%, but it sure looks like it was up a lot year-over-year. Or
was the problem in the first 6 weeks of the year much more gross add-driven and not really a churn problem?

And then second, and it sounds like Lowell is not on, but I thought the CNBC interview went really well and explained the fiber densification and
5G plan. But were his Bloomberg comments really -- they were confusing. And I think they confused a lot of investors. Were they misconstrued?
Or did he really open the door on deals like Disney, CBS and Comcast? And if so, what's changed since he clearly shot down speculation of interest
in CBS in December?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks, Phil. So on the churn question, I think it's, as you say, the first half of the quarter, we did see an uptick in churn. And then we saw it come
back down in the second half with the response to unlimited. Look, we had a lot of customers in the base who love being on the Verizon network
and the performance they get. But certainly, managing their data was a pain point. It was another thing to deal with in their lives. And so they were
-- there was some interest from the unlimited functionality. And as other people were offering that, we saw some people choose to make that
tradeoff between quality of network and not having to manage their data. And so as soon as we went to the unlimited offering and we gave people
the option on not having to make a tradeoff, they could have unlimited data and be on the Best Network, we saw an immediate improvement in
the churn number, where our base is saying, "This is where we want to be." And we've certainly seen that continue as we head into the second
quarter.

Now your second question, so okay, there's a -- there's obviously been a lot over the past 24 hours around this, but let's break this down. Lowell
was asked a question in an interview about if a certain company called and wanted to talk, would he take that meeting. And he responded, "Sure,
we'd take that meeting." And a need for emphasis, he added on just like if a couple of other companies called, we'd take the same meeting. What
this really comes down to and is consistent with what he said on the CNBC interview was, we're looking at how we execute our strategy. We're
confident in executing our strategy organically. But if there's the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way that
adds shareholder value, we're always looking at those opportunities. But I think the story was a little taken out of context. He was answering a
question about if somebody called, would we take the call and would we have a conversation with them. Of course, we would. But we're also very
confident with the assets we have and the plans we have of developing the business in an organic fashion as well and generating shareholder
value.

Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Partner and Senior Research Analyst

So I know you're going to get tired of trying to be asked all these same questions the same way, but if I take your -- the answer that you just gave
describing the situation with respect to M&A, is that to say that the status quo of your network densification strategy, do you view that as a sufficient
solution then? And do you have confidence that, that sort of re-leads Verizon to a network superiority position?

And then lastly, if you could just comment on -- you talked about the momentum into the second quarter. Could you comment on whether you
think the dynamics of the -- as we enter the second quarter are actually a bit better? Sprint has moved off of its -- some of its most aggressive
promotions. Do you think that the competitive intensity has moderated even a little bit? Or are we still in that same bad cycle that we were in, in
Q1?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. So I'll take your first question there. Look, you mentioned -- you made the comment there, Craig, about re-lead in network superiority. That
would imply that at some point that we didn't -- we've given up the lead in network superiority, and that clearly hasn't happened. You can look in
any of the third-party results of the testing they do over the past year, and you can see, if anything, we've widened the lead. So network superiority
will continue to be at the forefront of what we do. We're very confident that customers value that. And we're very confident that we will lead as
we move into 5G, we'll have that network out there first, have customer offerings around that technology out there first, and that will give us an
opportunity to work to continue to expand the business just like we have with previous generations of technology.

In terms of your dynamics in the second quarter in the marketplace, look, we'll have to wait and see. Right now, we're very happy with how the
customer base is responding to the offers that we have out there. We'll have to see what the competition does. And we will continue to be
competitive in the marketplace, but we will do that in a disciplined fashion and we'll see how the quarter plays out.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Just on the follow-up question about network superiority. That's true, every third-party report seems to have Verizon by a wide lead ahead, but --
which leads to the question about spectrum. I realize you can't comment on the most recent auction. But can you just talk, Matt, in general, how
comfortable you are with your spectrum position as you sit now? And then for the 11 markets, can you comment on what spectrum you'll be using
for that last mile of the 5G?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes, Jennifer. So for the 5G trials that we're doing, we're using the 28-gigahertz spectrum that we have the right to use as part of the arrangement
we have with XO.

In terms of your broader question about our spectrum position, we're very confident in it. Approximately 50% of our current spectrum holdings
are delivering our 5G network today. So we have significant opportunity to -- sorry, of our 4G usage today. We have significant opportunities to
continue to grow within the spectrum holdings that we currently have. We're refarming spectrum as we've talked about for a while. We still have

the AWS-3 spectrum. And then on-license will come into the portfolio as go forward, too. In addition to using spectrum, though, the way the
spectrum is used continues to get more efficient based off of the network architecture and advancements in the technology. LTE Advanced, we've
talked a lot about. There continues to be additions to that. And so as we look forward, we're very confident that we have the spectrum we need to
continue to deliver the best-in-class 4G experience.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

And Matt, if I may, just one quick follow-up. So nothing you've seen since late February with the usage that's come from unlimited. It seems like
that nothing has changed in terms of the need for more spectrum. It's just would be consistent with what your prior comments were.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes, we saw -- we obviously saw an uptick in usage, but it was as expected. One of the reasons we waited until February to launch unlimited was
we said to ourselves, if we're ever going to do unlimited, we are not going to do it at the expense of the core brand promise, which is the network
performance. And so we spent a lot of time in the back half of last year asking ourselves, is the network ready for unlimited. We did a lot of testing
around the network. And so we concluded that the network was ready for that. What we've seen since we launched from a usage standpoint, and
it's been in line with our expectations. The other important thing, of course, is when we launched it, we gave ourselves the opportunity to network
manage when a user goes past 22 gigs. And so that's an important point in managing the network in an unlimited world. And so we're very
comfortable with the experience we've seen so far.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst

Matt, just maybe a comment on the margin trade-off of the ARPA changes that we've seen. A lot of promotional activity, and you guys have done
some yourself there, that sort of versus the lower volumes that we're seeing out there. And I guess just trying to get a sense for whether or not
wireless margins have sort of seen their peak, if you will.

And then with respect to the sub losses, unlimited obviously had a positive impact. But it just seems like network quality is no longer resonating
with consumers. I'm just trying to get a sense for how you guys think about differentiating against the peers going forward other than just the
simple rate card.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. So on your last comment around network quality resonating, I would say that I completely disagree with that statement. We know from talking
with our customers that network quality matters, that they value the quality of our network. The fact that they have the reliability to get on the
network and stay on the network no matter what they're doing or where they are is tremendously important to them. And that shows up in the
churn rate that we have coming in below 0.9% for 8 quarters in a row and, certainly, the improvement we saw there post launch. So this narrative
that network no longer matters, I think we completely disagree with. And I think that shows up in the numbers and the results that we show.

In terms of the margin trade-off, I think, look, when you look in there into the ARPA decline, this is a continuation of the decline because we're
breaking apart the service revenue and the handset revenue. When you look at the I-ARPA number, which is really the billings we give the customer
every month, that includes the handset billing. That's still up year-over-year. So we feel -- we continue to feel good about that trajectory. And as
you think about our move to unlimited, we did it in a way where we added the functionality, but it wasn't a price reduction. We think that this offer
will be ARPA neutral over time, will initially see the impact of optimizers. And we'll also see the impact of reduced overage, but we also have the

ability for customers to come on the network on a metered plan and then step up over time. And even our base is stepping up from some of the
lower-data buckets to get on unlimited. So there's some offsets there that, we think, means that unlimited is not going to be a reduction in ARPA.
And this is why we say when we introduced it, we did so in a disciplined fashion, which is something you should expect to see from us as we go
forward and respond to the marketplace.

Operator

Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst

Building upon that last question, when you folks originally introduced your outlook for 2017, there was an expectation for a pushout in terms of
the recovery or the growth of service revenues. Given where we are today, how should we think about the potential drivers for service revenue
growth in future periods? You originally called the unlimited plan introductory. And I'm just trying to think about the different moving factors and
where we could see that potential opportunity to drive service revenue growth in the future. Then I've just got one follow-up from here.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Okay. So on the trajectory, we still feel confident that we'll see an improvement in the wireless trajectory as we go through the year and a stronger
overall result from year-over-year number versus last year. Now what we will see is, in the second quarter, we'll see a continuation of the impact
of the optimizations, both to the customers that came on to the Verizon plan last summer and also on unlimited. But then at the back half of the
year, we'll see the trend start to improve. And we are -- we continue to be confident that we'll see wireless service revenue get back to positive on
a year-over-year basis during 2018. So I think the big thing as you look there, as we continue to keep pricing at the right levels, we have the
opportunity to step customers up. And as we are more successful in adding customers in the marketplace, as we showed in the back half of the
quarter, that gives us the opportunity to move those trends in the right direction.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst

Great. And then one follow-up and -- to some of the prior commentary you made. You discussed this idea of longer-term shareholder value in the
event some sort of opportune inorganic asset comes to market. What parameters do you sort of gauge that shareholder value by? I know you have
remained committed to delevering the balance sheet to these pre-Vodafone levels during the 2018 and 2019 period. I was wondering, is there
flexibility around that if the right asset was to present itself? Or any color you can provide around that would be most helpful.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes, absolutely. So I think there's been a little surprise by some comments we've made over the past few months around this. And really, internally,
there was no change in how we viewed this. We certainly have the target to get back to that leverage ratios and credit metrics as we discussed.
But we've always believed, and maybe it's just because we've said it more explicitly over the past few months, but look, if you give me 2 options,
option a is I -- an opportunity comes up and I say, "No, I can't do it because it mean I couldn't hit that leverage target." Or option b is I do a transaction
that allows me to accelerate the strategy of the company, improve my competitiveness in the marketplace and do it in a fashion that allows me to
improve shareholder value versus the first option, but it means that I have to push out when I get back to those leverage targets, it's the right thing
to do to do the second option. If it means we push out when we get to those targets because we have a great opportunity, we're going to do that.
There's no change there. But I will say that we continue to be committed to a strong balance sheet, whether or not we have any inorganic activity.

And your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.

Tim Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Matt, it seems like some of your competitors have really been aggressive on slashing OpEx and CapEx. And I know now you've had a little bit more
time to look at Verizon what your competitors have done. I guess, do you have the ability to do this -- the same thing? And maybe a little color
around this reorganization, what that kind of means in terms of expense reductions over time.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. So I'd say they've been talking about these reductions in OpEx over the past year or 2. I think you've heard us talk about it for more years than
that now. We continue to look at and manage the cost of the business down, and I think you see that in the results. You certainly can see it clearly
in the results in the Wireline segment, for example. So we look at managing OpEx and reducing it, not as a program for a year or 2, but something
we do every year. Every year, we have cost-reduction targets for each of the business units. And they diligently work on those and have a great
track record of delivering them. As I think about CapEx, one of the great things about our business is we produce a significant amount of cash flow
that allows us to continue to invest in the business. And we do that so that we position the business to be able to deliver products not for our
customers just for today, but as we head into the future. Because of the nature of the business we're in, we're always looking at least 1 to 2 years
out in terms of what we need. So we continue to do that and make sure that we're providing the connectivity solutions that our customers need
as we go forward. However, saying that, we look at how we continue to get more efficient in that, and you'll see us continually do that. The cost to
add capacity in the network continues to come down, and it comes down because of the things our network team has done for many years and
how we work with the vendors in the space. So we don't make as much of a big deal about what we do to manage OpEx and CapEx efficiencies.
But I can absolutely guarantee you, it's a key focus within the business and we have a great track record of fulfilling that.

In terms of the reorganization, I think, look, this is just an opportunity to make sure we stay focused on the key things to us, which is the network
and continuing to build the network, not just the network of today, but the networks we need going forward, the focus on managing the customer
base and growing the base, retaining the base and generating loyalty and then generating those new businesses, whether that be in the Media
Co., telematics or the broader IoT space. So it's a -- it was really to make sure the organization is aligned with those strategic goals of the company.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you for your questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt for some closing comments.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The first quarter showed our ability to compete effectively in a financially disciplined
manner. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities, led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage,
maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model and creating value for our customers and shareholders. We are positioning the company for
long-term growth. A key foundational element of our vision of the future is our strong network assets. Our strong networks will enable us to be at
the center of this new connected world of people and things and give us the opportunity to participate globally in the advancing digital ecosystems.
We look forward to the tremendous opportunity to leverage all of our assets and are confident in our ability to execute our strategy. Thank you for
your time today.

We plan to recast the 2017 Form 10-K following the filing of our first-quarter 2018 Form 10-Q to address the adoption of the pension and cash flow
reporting standards that require retrospective treatment.

Before Matt goes through results I would like to walk through a few items. For the first quarter 2018 we reported earnings of $1.11 per share on a
GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight.

Our reported first-quarter earnings include an early debt redemption charge of about $249 million and roughly $107 million of acquisition and
integration costs primarily related to Oath. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $266 million or $0.06 per share.

Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.17 in the first quarter compared to $0.95 a year ago. Included in the
difference is approximately $0.21 due to the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard. On a comparable basis
adjusted earnings per share, before the impacts of tax reform and revenue recognition, was up 1.1% year-over-year.

Next I would like to discuss the revenue recognition standard impact on our results. In order to provide additional clarity regarding the impact of
the revenue recognition standard on our quarterly results, we've included the table on slide 4 that illustrates the effect across the business.

The impact of the revenue recognition standard resulted in a reduction of wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment
revenue, as well as the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. For the remainder of this call we will discuss
results excluding the impact of the accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods unless otherwise noted.

With that I will now turn the call over to Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start with a recap of our priorities for 2018 which we laid out
earlier this year. We are laser focused on executing on the fundamentals, positioning the business for future growth and delivering sustainable
financial performance for long-term value creation.

We are enhancing our network leadership position, strengthening our customer relationships and driving efficiencies throughout the business.
The cornerstone of our strategy is to provide customers with the best network and user experience as reflected by our strong customer loyalty.
We have again been recognized by RootMetrics as the best overall network outright for reliability, speed, data and core performance for the 9th
straight reporting period.

As streaming video has become the primary driver of data usage, Verizon stands alone in providing the leading performance of video delivery.
Recently our wireless network was recognized by another third-party as having the best video success rate and the largest percentage of video
streaming in high definition across the industry.

Through our investments in spectrum, including millimeter wave, deployments of dense fiber network architecture and expansion of software
defined networking capabilities, Verizon remains the clear leader in 4G and has the assets to provide the broadest, fastest and most advanced
next-generation network in the world.

The demand for our fiber-based products continues to accelerate and our Intelligent Edge network design gives us the ability to meet customer
needs for broadband and mobility services in an environment where quality of connection matters more now than ever before.

In addition, the evolution of our Intelligent Edge network architecture provides the flexibility and efficiencies to offer increased capacity and
throughput, low latency, unmatched reliability and enhanced speeds.

APRIL 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We have started the year with strong momentum and have delivered solid financial performance including consolidated revenue growth led by
continued progress in the wireless business. It has now been a full year since we launched our original unlimited plans and the offerings have
evolved to provide value and choice for customers. We will continue to mold our compelling value proposition and provide the quality of network
and user experience that customers demand.

In an unlimited wireless world we are driving revenue accretion through increasing the number of customer relationships and deepening the
participation within our existing base by adding more devices and services. In addition, we are pre-positioned in the network to further enhance
wireless growth opportunities with next-generation technologies.

Our 5G deployment is progressing as planned. We are quickly approaching the initial launch of our residential broadband service later this year
which will be the first use case of a broader 5G strategy. We are driving the ecosystem for future growth across the entire array of 5G services.

With regard to our Oath business, we are deepening the engagement with our user base, creating opportunities for further monetization in the
future. Consolidated EBITDA increased as we leveraged our scale and drove operational efficiencies through business excellence initiatives. Our
disciplined capital allocation model allowed us to strengthen the business while investing in our networks of future growth and long-term value
creation.

Let's dig deeper into the first-quarter operating performance at the consolidated level followed by wireless and wireline results and our media and
telematics businesses. Now on to slide 6.

Consolidated revenue was $29.9 billion, excluding the impact of Oath and divested businesses, an increase of approximately 3.2%. The primary
driver was solid performance in the wireless business with improved service revenue results as customers enjoyed unlimited access on the nation's
best wireless network. We are on track to deliver low single-digit percentage consolidated revenue growth on a reported basis for the full year
2018.

On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, first-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.8%, which was down 70 basis points due to higher
wireless equipment revenue and the inclusion of Yahoo! in this year's results. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.5 billion due to steady improvement
in operational efficiencies and increased penetration across our high-quality customer base. With that we are on track to realize low single-digit
percentage growth in adjusted EPS in 2018 before the impact of tax reform and revenue recognition.

Let's turn now to slide 7 to review cash flow results and the balance sheet. In the first quarter cash flow from operations totaled $6.6 billion, up $5.3
billion from last year. This was primarily driven by stronger operational results, lower discretionary pension contributions and, as we have previously
communicated, the reduction of working capital headwinds from the completion of the device payment plan portfolio transition from
off-balance-sheet to on balance sheet financing.

As part of our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet and providing financial flexibility to grow the business, we made a discretionary
pension contribution of $1.0 billion to improve the funded status of our pension plans. As a result we do not project to have any mandatory pension
contributions until approximately 2026.

Total capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion over the prior year. We maintain our 2018 guidance range for capital
expenditures of $17.0 billion to $17.8 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be more evenly distributed throughout 2018 than in previous years.

Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up $3.8 billion. We ended the quarter with $119.1 billion of total debt comprised of $109.0 billion
of unsecured debt and $10.1 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Total debt was up $2.5 billion year-over-year primarily due to an increase
in our asset backed borrowings of $3.8 billion. The total debt balance is expected to decline as we begin to realize the cash benefits of tax reform
later this year.

Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments starting with wireless on slide 8. Total wireless operating revenue increased 4.7% to $21.9
billion in the first quarter. Service revenue performance produced solid results in the quarter driven by customer step ups to higher access plans,

the quality of our overall customer experience and value proposition, as well as our measured approach to promotional activity in a highly competitive
environment.

On May 8 of last year we used the chart on the lower half of the slide to communicate the impact of unlimited on service revenue trajectory and
our expectations for future trends to improve. We are pleased to report that service revenue for the quarter was flat versus the prior year. We saw
a year-over-year improvement throughout the quarter with service revenue turning positive in the month of March.

We now have 81% of our postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans compared to 72% for the same period last year. On a reported basis, including
the revenue recognition standard, service revenue was down 2.4%. We expect the momentum in the service revenue trajectory to continue and
we are on track for growth to turn positive on a reported basis around the end of the year.

Equipment revenue increased 22.1% driven by the mix of high-priced handsets and increased activations. Approximately 49% of postpaid phone
customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance at the end of the quarter, similar to last year. Our wireless EBITDA margin as a percent
of total revenue was 46.3%. This represents an improvement of 120 basis points driven by the strength of our service revenue results and ongoing
focus on operational excellence throughout the business.

Let's now turn to slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. First quarter is seasonally the lowest volume period of the year coming
off of the holiday retail season. Overall we gained 260,000 postpaid net adds consisting of phone losses of 24,000 and tablet losses of 75,000 offset
by 359,000 other connected devices, primarily wearables.

Smart phone net additions for the quarter were 220,000 as customers look to connect their sophisticated devices to the best wireless network in
the US. Our unlimited offerings continue to provide a compelling value and overall customer experience that has led to postpaid phone churn of
0.80% for the quarter. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of customer retention at 0.80% or better.

Total retail postpaid churn of 1.04% decreased year-over-year. Total postpaid device activations were 2.3% higher than the prior year of which
about 80% were phones. In a seasonally low quarter we had 5.0% of our retail postpaid base upgrade to a new device, down from 5.2%. During
the quarter 77% of phone activations were on device payment plans. Prepaid activity in the quarter reflected a total net loss of 335,000 devices of
which 261,000 were basic phone losses.

Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 10. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 1.8% for the quarter as growth
from our high-quality fiber-based products was more than offset by secular pressures from legacy technology shifts, trends from cord cutting and
pricing pressures in a highly competitive environment.

Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.7% primarily driven by legacy core revenue declines. Fios consumer revenue increased 1.2% driven by
the growing demand for high-quality broadband service. The mix shift away from triple play bundles pressured revenue trends, but the margin
impact was largely offset by the corresponding reduction in content expenditures.

We added 66,000 Fios Internet customers on the strength of our high-speed fiber offerings as customers seek the best broadband experience. Fios
Video losses of 22,000 were indicative of the continued secular trend for cord cutting on the traditional linear video bundle.

Excluding the XO acquisition, enterprise solutions revenue decreased 4.2% in the quarter driven primarily by declines in legacy products and pricing
pressure in the market that more than offset growth in demand for fiber-based services. On a constant currency basis the year-over-year decline
was 5.7%.

Partner solutions revenue decreased 0.4% without XO. We see fiber demand as the main driver for future growth opportunities within this segment.
In business markets revenue declined 5.7% without XO. We have good trajectory with our fiber-based services but these are offset by declines in
legacy products.

Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 20.4%. We continue to benefit from operational efficiency gains, but steady increases in content costs and
secular pressures within legacy technologies remain headwinds.

Let's now move on to slide 11 to discuss our media and IOT businesses. The integration of the Oath assets is progressing well, accelerating our
mobile first strategy and positioning us at global reach and future growth in premium content distribution and programmatic advertising capabilities
across our key verticals.

As expected, Oath gross revenue decreased sequentially about 13% from the fourth quarter to $1.9 billion due to seasonally lower display advertising
volumes. Our organizational integration was largely completed in 2017 and the focus in 2018 has now shifted to streamlining platforms and
products, unlocking cost and revenue synergies on the way.

During the quarter we achieved a full integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo! video supply side platforms into a unified platform and go-to-market
strategy. This positions the business for future growth as we establish our role as a value-added partner for advertising customers.

In the telematics business, as part of the ongoing integration of the Fleetmatics and Telogis acquisitions, we have created the new Verizon Connect
organization. Total Verizon Connect revenue was $234 million in the first quarter. Total IOT revenue, including Verizon Connect, was up approximately
13%.

Let's now move to slide 12 to review our strategy for future growth. We are confident in our strategy of laying the foundation for future growth
while maintaining a strong leadership position in 4G LTE coverage, reliability and capacity. The execution model remains unchanged in terms of
delivering strong financial results, allocating capital to position the business for future growth while strengthening our balance sheet and returning
long-term value to our shareholders.

Our wireless value proposition is allowing more and more customers to experience unlimited service on the best network in the United States. We
exited the quarter with strong momentum and produced operational and financial performance in a highly competitive environment while investing
in all our businesses and driving cost efficiencies.

Last year we announced our goal to drive $10 billion in cumulative cash savings throughout the business over the next four years. Our business
excellence initiative, which includes implementing zero-based budgeting, has already yielded positive results in the first quarter, realizing
approximately $200 million of savings through process improvements, work streamlining and automation. The program is on track to deliver
against our goals over the four-year period.

In addition to the operational improvements in the business, the benefits from corporate tax reform will be realized throughout the remainder of
the year, which will provide additional flexibility and enable us to execute on our commitment of strengthening the balance sheet. We are
prepositioning our networks with fiber infrastructure, spectrum resources and the rollout of our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network architecture.

We are excited about the initial commercial launch of our 5G residential broadband offering later this year as the first slice of a multi-use asset. We
are on the forefront of innovation that will drive the full suite of services and use cases that will be delivered by 5G technologies.

We have successfully completed our 11 city 5G pre-commercial trials where we demonstrated propagation over 2,000 feet from the node on
millimeter wave spectrum. We have moved into the commercial deployment phase for the residential broadband launch in the second half of this
year.

Deployment of commercial nodes on our own fiber asset is underway in the initial markets. And earlier this month we performed successful
end-to-end 5G data sessions in these locations using commercial equipment that will be deployed in the launch later this year.

The ecosystem for 5G is progressing with advancements being realized around global standards and technology developments. Progress is being
made at the state and city level to drive sustainable economics around cell site deployment creating the pathway to better serving their communities.

Millimeter wave spectrum enables a whole new array of services that will be delivered through ultra-wideband 5G technologies. We are well
positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities that 5G has to offer.

With that I will turn the call back over to Brady so we can get to your questions.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you, Matt. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions). Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

I wanted to follow up on the 5G broadband rollout. When do you think you'll give us more visibility about the three to five markets, the timeline
around when you're rolling that out, how many homes?

And then related questions, I think you said pre-standards. When do you think the standards-based CPE will be available so you can really scale
this? And then finally, what's your video strategy here? Are you going to have an OTT offering to the bundle with the broadband product? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

So, in terms of the timeline for the three to five markets, as we said earlier this year and when we made the announcement on November 29, all of
those markets will launch in the second half of this year. So we announced that Sacramento will be one of those cities and the other cities we'll
announce as we get closer to launch date.

But we are very much on track with being in a position to launch each of those cities later this year. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we
are in the process of deploying assets in each of those markets and look forward to bringing that service to consumers in those markets in 2018.

As you mentioned, the launch this year will be on our proprietary standard and this gives us the opportunity to get a product out in the market
before others and to demonstrate that millimeter wave does exactly the things that we've said it does. But obviously over time we want to move
to the standards-based CPE. And we expect to be getting that CPE based off of the NR standard probably in 2019.

Look, what I would say is the network is being prepositioned to be able to launch 5G as soon as customer equipment is ready. Whether that be
in-home CPE for residential broadband or whether that be handsets for 5G mobility, we will be ready as soon as equipment is ready on the global
standard.

And then your final question was around a video strategy for the residential broadband launch. So that's -- we've got that underway. We continue
to look at OTT options and, as we've said previously, we are not looking to launch a me too product, but certainly expect to have an overall product
offering to consumers in those three to five markets that will be compelling and meet their needs.

Operator

Philip Cusick, JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

I wonder if I can follow up first on my question from January about your target leverage. Has the Company come up with a way to think about
leverage under the new tax regime, especially with no cash pension obligations for the next eight years?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, so, Phil, we continue to look at our goal to improve leverage and really to get back to that pre-Vodafone credit rating. And we have had plenty
of conversations with the rating agencies around that and how our leverage looks in a post tax reform world.

But look, we are in a great position. As we demonstrated this quarter, we grew the EBITDA side of the business. And then as we talked about, as
the benefits of tax reform kick in from a cash basis later this year, we'll see improvements in the debt side of it. So we are on track to improve the
leverage and look forward to in the not too distant future to be having that conversation with the agencies about the timing of being in a position
to get us back to where we want.

But I think if you look historically where our leverage ratios were on an adjusted basis when you adjust for the Cellco ownership, you have a fair
idea of where we're trying to get to. So there's a few points of turn to go but not a massive amount.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Okay. And if I can follow up on Simon's question as well. If some carriers and vendors are pulling back from 5G, how has Verizon's thinking evolved
on 5G this year?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, we continue to be very excited about the opportunities that 5G has. I don't think in the US we've seen people pulling back from 5G at all. In
fact, I think you've seen a lot of very bullish commentary. So we will be launching the residential broadband later this year. We are on track with
that.

Certainly happy to have the assets in place to do that, whether that be what we've done with the network over the past few years as we have
densified the network, putting more fiber out there, which really prepositions us to deploy 5G. Gaining the 28 and 39 GHz spectrum that puts us
in a position to be ready to deploy when the equipment is ready from the OEMs.

So, we are very bullish about 5G. We think there's tremendous upside whether that be residential broadband, whether it be mobility. And really
the most exciting piece is as you get into the new use cases that don't exist on the current technologies around IoT, B2B type applications. So we
are full steam ahead on our 5G deployment.

APRIL 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

I'm actually going to follow up on what you were just discussing. When we talk to investors about 5G and we talk about the fixed use case, I think
they all understand the addressable market and it's just a matter of how effective the product is going to be.

But when we talk about mobility -- and, as you noted, many of these use cases don't exist yet -- are you comfortable accelerating capital investment
into developing a mobile 5G network without visibility on those use cases? And if not, is there going to be a point where we might see an inflection
in CapEx higher where you see that forming?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

So, I don't see us having a massive acceleration in CapEx. As you heard, we reiterated our guidance for 2018. That guidance of $17.0 billion to $17.8
billion is the same range of actual spending we've had over the past four years. So what investors should have grown accustomed to seeing from
Verizon is consistent total capital spend on a disciplined and methodical manner, but the items within that spend evolve over time as the technologies
evolve.

So this year we've already started spend on 5G. The spend on those three to five initial launch cities began earlier this year, so that's ongoing. You
should expect to see spend in additional cities be underway by the end of the year so that we are in a position to launch additional geographies
in 2019. But that's within our current CapEx guidance.

And as we look forward we continue to believe that we can deploy the network within the typical range. If we see an opportunity to accelerate
because of the market we're not afraid to do so, but it will be based off our view of the opportunity we have in the marketplace.

But this really comes back to the design of the network over the past few years. By densifying the 4G network we've put a lot of the infrastructure
in place that we need to deploy 5G especially using millimeter wave spectrum. So, we don't see this as being a massive uptick. This is not the same
thing as when we adopted 4G and went from a CDMA based 3G network to the 4G LTE network. This is a very different network rollout and I think
you'll see that in the CapEx as we go forward.

So look, you mentioned the different revenue buckets. We are very comfortable that certainly the mobility bucket gives us the opportunity to
deepen our relationship with our existing customer base and look to grow that base. Residential broadband is an existing market that we have
opportunity to grow share in.

And then the new use cases at lower latency and higher throughput and the ability to connect many, many more devices to each individual node
will create significant upside as well. But this is a multi-use asset that we think will have a strong return over time.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

And just to be clear, your comment about capital intensity during your 5G upgrade, you were referring to both the fixed and mobile components
of it? That was not unique to the fixed employment?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

It's the same deployment. I mean, we're not building a 5G network for residential broadband and then a different 5G network for mobility. We are
deploying a 5G network that will have multiple revenue streams off of it. So we are very excited about the ability to do that. And in addition to
having multiple revenue streams, we are using a lot of existing assets we have in the field already today.

Operator

John Hodulik, UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Matt, obviously a lot of changes going on in the media space. And one of your largest competitors, AT&T, is investing in traditional media assets
while you guys have focused more on new media platforms. Are you seeing anything that would change your view on that approach or any value
created by combining through your distribution assets with what you see in the traditional media world? And has your guys' thinking on that
evolved over time? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, I mean certainly it has evolved over time, but it's very consistent with what we said earlier this year. At this point in time, as we look at the
ecosystem, we are very comfortable with the approach of making sure we have distribution rights to digital content. And you saw that with the
NFL deal, the NBA deal, and I would expect to see us continue to add to that portfolio of digital rights to distribute across various Yahoo! platforms,
Oath platforms as we go forward.

So look, the content space is evolving rapidly and we think the best approach for us at this point in time is to be that independent distributor of
rights out there. And we're very comfortable that we will be very effective doing that. So no major change in terms of our approach from when we
spoke on the earnings call 90 days ago.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Okay, but just a quick follow-up. But the possibility of you guys making a more profound investment in traditional media assets like networks,
whether they be cable networks or broadcast networks, should we think of that is still off the table or subject to change as we see things evolve
in the media landscape?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, I would certainly say not at this time. When we look at the landscape out there it is evolving very fast. And I'm not going to say never on
anything, but when I look at it right now in the foreseeable future I don't see that being the right time to jump in.

So we are pursuing a strategy that we've discussed. We are going to continue to add content to the Oath platforms, bring some of that content
across our other distribution, whether that is wireless or Fios. And we think there is significant runway to that strategy and we will continue to
monitor the broader ecosystem.

APRIL 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

And also it's been about a year since you (technical difficulty) unlimited. Can you discuss what the current consumption of data traffic (technical
difficulty) smartphone and how you keep (technical difficulty) of the network?

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Hey, Mike, you were breaking up in the last part of that question. I think you were talking about unlimited and data consumption. Can you clarify
that back part?

Michael Rollins - Citigroup - Analyst

Yes, if you could just talk about the consumption of smart phone users and how it's impacting network quality.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, absolutely. So look, I will tell you we have seen significant increase in data usage as we move to unlimited, as expected. We also saw a change
in where that usage was taking place as the busy hour of the day changed and also the geography where that changed. So we've seen that increase
level off. We are still seeing year-over-year increases but not the same levels that we saw after we launched unlimited and it's got back to more
normal growth rates.

But you asked about what we are seeing in terms of quality across the network. And I'd just come back to all of the data that we use ourselves from
testing our network and others out there and then what we see from third parties. And our network continues to be the standard by which all
others are measured. And that has continued to be the case even after we launched 5G.

So when we launched 5G we said we had spent a good amount of time making sure the network was ready for it. I believe the performance over
the past 12 months has demonstrated the fantastic job that our network team has done, meaning that as we moved into an unlimited world and
we saw data usage increase, we continue to deliver the high quality of service that people expect from us. So I expect that to fully continue. But
the network is performing incredibly well and we continue to add capacity, and so we are in great shape there.

Your first question around cost-cutting, so $200 million approximately so far this year. And as we continue to move forward we all have additional
savings kick in as well. Certainly the ones that require deeper amount of process change will come in later in the course of the program than some
of the other ones. But you should see it more backend loaded.

I think it will be reasonably even throughout 2018 and then you'll see some of the structural changes kick into a greater degree over the back half
of the four-year program. But we are very encouraged by what we've seen so far, but we're really just starting and there's a long way to go.

Operator

David Barden, Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

I guess the first one, just another cadence question, Matt. I guess last quarter you gave us the heads up about the seasonal weakness in the Oath
business in the first quarter. And I think relative to wireless EBITDA outperformance and wireline EBITDA kind of in line, it seems like Oath and
related corporate initiatives were maybe a little bit of a weak spot. Could you paint the picture for how that relatively sizable segment now might
track over the course of the rest of 2018?

And I guess the second question would be related to the business market related aspects of tax reform. Have you been able to see any economic
effect on your business business as a result of tax reform, kind of those conversations changing kind of the outlook brightening? Anything related
to that would be helpful. Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

So look, I'd like to tell you that I've seen a significant change in the level of demand from our enterprise customers. But look, it's really too early. I
think if we look at it from our own IT department, they are not immediate because we've got tax reform turning around and doing significant
changes in their IT spend and their telco spend. So we'll see if that picks up as the year goes on, but nothing significant in the trajectory so far in
that group.

In terms of the cadence through the year, I think we said on the last call that we expected Oath to be down sequentially from 4Q to 1Q just with
the seasonal change in advertising volumes. And we certainly saw that; the results came in as we expected.

So really from this point forward we should expect to see a sequential improvement from what we saw in first quarter really for two reasons. One,
you just got the seasonality impact that builds throughout the year. And then secondly, we are getting the underlying platforms integrated between
the legacy AOL, the legacy Yahoo! platforms, and so that when advertisers come into our business going forward they can come in through one
platform rather than the multiple platforms they come through today.

So, as we get the rest of that integration work completed it will make us easier to do business with and we think that will show up in the results.
But that's an ongoing exercise and I don't think we'll really start to see that until really the backend of the year. And so, as we head into 2019 the
momentum should be significantly different than it is today. So hopefully that gives you a little insight there.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

And if I could just do one quick follow-up, maybe related to John's question on media appetite. As you knit these two businesses together, the idea
was to have the third biggest scale digital media platform in the world maybe. And do you feel like you've accomplished that goal and that you're
getting the benefits of that scale? Or is incremental scale something that's necessary to really get you to the next level?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

We have the scale today. That was why the Yahoo! acquisition made so much sense. It got us to being around 1 billion monthly active users. So
now the challenge for the business is to deepen the relationship with those customers.

Look, if we grow the number of monthly active users that's great, I'd be very happy to do so. But the biggest opportunity for us is to deepen the
relationship we have with those consumers. We do that by bringing additional compelling content such as NFL, NBA across those assets, and you
saw what we did with those properties and more to come there.

And then once you use content like that to get them on the platform you have other content there that keeps them on the platform. And then
when we keep them on the platform that gives us the opportunity to increase the attractiveness to our advertising partners. So you will see us
focused on increasing engagement with the base that we have, but we have the scale that we need to be successful in that business.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Analyst

Matt, I know you talked about not a strong level of interest in media, but it was widely reported that you at least looked at it and put in a bid for
the Fox asset. So I guess if I think about assets that are for sale, you were at least looking at Fox. It sounds as though there's maybe some spectrum
coming from -- whether Intelsat or Dish Network always out there. And then you've also talked about your balance sheet objectives.

Can you roll all that up for us and talk about how your priorities -- how you would rank your priorities across spectrum, other operating assets or
balance sheet reductions? And then -- and just one quick nuance in that, your Fox bid was reportedly all stock. Would that suggest that you would
not be willing to add leverage for a big acquisition?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, so look, I'm not going to comment on any specific M&A rumors. That's not been our policy and I'm not going to start now. But let's talk about
content and M&A in general.

So, I've commented already this morning that we certainly are comfortable with the approach that we have around content across the Oath
platforms and other parts of our business and we're very focused on executing against that. M&A to us is a tool to help execute our strategy. If M&A
allows us to accelerate the execution of our strategy at a value that provides a return it's something we look at. But it has to be consistent with the
strategy and it has to have value.

We don't operate in a vacuum. Lowell and I have to be aware of activity and opportunities around us and we have an obligation to make sure we
understand those. So, we keep an eye on everything going on in the ecosystem. But when we do M&A it's because it fits with the strategy.

And if you look at the past year the only significant transactions we did, whether it was Yahoo, XO and Straight Path, they very clearly accelerate
our strategy, whether that be around adding the necessary scale to our media assets, as we just talked about just a couple minutes ago, or
pre-positioning our networks for being -- continuing the excellence in 4G world. And also being in a position to succeed in 5G, whether that's
adding fiber through XO or are adding the spectrum assets through XO and Straight Path. We put ourselves in a position where we can execute
our strategy and compete and generate value for shareholders over the long-term.

So I wouldn't necessarily want to prioritize what's the most interesting thing for us to look at. We are very comfortable executing our strategy on
a mostly organic basis. If the right opportunities come up we take a look at them. The vast majority of things we look at don't create value and
therefore we pass on them because that's the responsible thing to do to create long-term value.

Strengthening the balance sheet is important to us, but positioning the business for long-term future growth that creates value for shareholders
is also very important. And I think we've balanced those things very well over the past few years and I expect to continue to do so.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst

Two if I may. Just on the service revenue guidance, you achieved it excluding the new accounting recognition ahead of schedule and I guess two
questions. Why the guidance still for midyear? Could you continue to see it in the second quarter? And then secondly, is Comcast MVNO service
revenue included in that line? I think some are wondering if that's why we hit it ahead of schedule. Thanks.

APRIL 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, so let me answer the last one first. Yes, certainly our service revenue includes all service revenues related to connectivity to our network,
whether that be our postpaid, whether that be prepaid or MVNO, those service revenues that we generate from operating the network. But I would
not say that any of these pieces fit. And within the wholesale side of our business, in addition to the MSOs, obviously track phones, they are by far
the biggest part of that business for us today.

But look, when you look at why we got there this quarter, I think it's predominantly because our postpaid business continues to do well. You see
it continue to add 220,000 smart phones, the network continues to perform well, churn is very low and that is driving the service revenue trajectory
as we described last year. We continue to add connections to our accounts, continue to deepen the relationship with our base and that allows us
to continue to grow the postpaid component of service revenue.

Operator

Amir Rozwadowski, Barclays.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

I was wondering if I could build upon Jennifer's prior question in terms of thinking about the cable operators. If we think about your guidance,
what is your expectation around competition from the cable folks with regards to their wireless services?

And any sort of potential reciprocal competition that may come from some of the incumbent players? Just trying to get your understanding of the
lay of the competitive landscape over the next several quarters as some of these services ramp.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, so, look, as these services have started it's pretty much been as expected in terms of the volumes we've seen. So I would expect there to be
continued competition in the marketplace. I think some of the activity you saw in the first quarter as a result of that. And I think you saw that we
had a disciplined approach to that activity in the quarter and you should expect that to continue.

We will be very focused on maintaining our high-quality base of customers and we will do the things that we need to in a responsible fashion to
do so. But look, any time you add additional players to the space that has the opportunity to increase competitiveness, but that's baked into our
plans for the year.

In the grand scheme of overall volumes the amount of activity coming from the new MVNOs is still relatively small and we would expect it to be
that way. But look, as they get traction they'll bring in more traffic to our network that we can monetize as well. So, we are happy with that side of
the equation too.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thanks very much, Matt. And then, if I may, a quick follow-up in thinking about your 5G strategy. You folks have laid out a case in terms of the
millimeter wave solution ramping better than anticipated from a tech perspective. And clearly your multiuse fiber infrastructure is creating a
foundational layer to upgrade with lower capital intensity or without the requirement for accelerated capital intensity.

But how should we think about mobility? Is there a need for a coverage layer of spectrum -- an additional layer of spectrum in order to launch 5G
from a mobility standpoint? And given some of the options available, whether it is 3.5 or any other option available, how should we think about
your strategy to deploy mobility on 5G?

APRIL 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

We can launch 5G mobility on our existing assets and -- but as we look forward, look, we have over our history continued to add spectrum to our
overall portfolio. If there's opportunities to do so at a reasonable price we would certainly do so again, but we are comfortable that we can launch
5G mobility with the assets we have.

5G mobility will be initially very much heavily focused on urban areas and we have the assets in place there. And we will be ready to launch that
as soon as the OEMs have handsets available with 5G chipsets in them.

Operator

Scott Goldman, Jefferies.

Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC - Analyst

Just a follow-up to that question and one earlier as well. Matt, as you look at -- you've talked a lot in the past about your ability to meet capacity
with the spectrum you have, as well as the incremental tools around MIMO and 256 QAM and so forth. But it looks as though we are heading for
a couple years of maybe a few auctions coming out of the FCC in terms of millimeter wave, the CBRS, the C band.

Can you just talk about your potential level of interest in acquiring more millimeter wave on top of what you have already acquired through Straight
Path and XO or perhaps those lower 3 GHz plus bands there?

And then just a follow-up on a question earlier. You talked a bit about the trajectory of Oath from a revenue perspective going forward and a bit
about the scale there. Just wondering how we should think about what the margin profile of that revenue looks like both in 2018 and perhaps as
you get two or three years out into that business. Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

So look, we have participated in numerous spectrum auctions over the years and there's also been auctions that we've either chosen not to
participate in or that we have participated only in certain areas such as the AWS3 auction. We are very comfortable with the spectrum assets that
we own as we move into a 5G world, but at the right price spectrum is interesting.

But as you've seen on 4G, there are multiple ways for us to add capacity to our network. And whether that be densification, whether that be more
spectrum, or whether that be deploying the evolving technologies, we take advantage of all of those things and we look to add capacity and overall
the service that our customers get at the cheapest possible way. And over time that's evolved.

But we will certainly take a look at any auction that comes up. And if it makes sense for us to participate we will. And if it doesn't then, well, we
have other avenues to continue to deploy our networks and meet the needs of our consumers.

On Oath, as you talk about the margin profile there, as they add to the revenue base we should see the margin profile of that business improve
certainly in the latter part of this year and then as you get into 2019 and 2020.

But the capital intensity of that business is very different from our network businesses. And so you should expect a different margin profile there,
certainly lower than you see within wireless. But when you net out the lower capital intensity with the margin profile the intent is to certainly have
a compelling return on investment.

Mike McCormack, Guggenheim Securities.

Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC - Analyst

Matt, just maybe a couple of follow-ups here. With respect to the competitive landscape, I know obviously you want to maintain your best customers,
but what's the overall philosophy on positive handset adds? How important is that to Verizon? And as you think about the next few quarters coming
up, the appetite for you guys to get perhaps more promotional to get back to positive on that?

On the cable wireless stuff, and maybe you can't share much, but any sort of early takeaways on the type of customers that are opting into that?
And anything you can share with respect to usage patterns would be great.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

On the cable, the type of customers, I don't think we're seeing anything particular there in terms of being one type of customer or another. But I
will let the cable guys give you more color on that as they see fit. The usage that we are seeing from those customers is as expected, so nothing
significantly different from what we see from the rest of our base.

You asked about the competitive landscape and, look, so we had 220,000 positive smartphone adds. Phones overall were slightly negative, but
that's not unusual for first quarter. We've seen that the past few years. And I think when you see the year as a whole you see that become positive
as momentum builds through the year.

I see no reason to believe that this year will be any different. We will be measured and disciplined in terms of our promotional response to the
marketplace, but we've been very successful at maintaining our base. You see the churn numbers, again, very strong four quarters in a row at 0.80
or better.

So we are maintaining our base, we deepen our relationships with our base in terms of the number of connections. And then we certainly look to
add new accounts and I think we've been successful doing that. We have more accounts now than we had a year ago.

And when you are increasing the number of accounts and you're increasing the connectivity with existing accounts, that's a good approach. And
we will continue to be focused on doing that, growing revenues and growing margin. So, nothing really changes in 2018 as we think about how
we are going to approach the wireless market.

Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC - Analyst

Just a quick follow-up on that percentage of customers that are on unsubsidized versus those that are making a phone payment, that delta continues
to be pretty wide. But can you just give us a sense for how much of that is bring your own device versus proactive retention versus phones that
are paid off?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, look, as you see the elongation in the ownership cycle you're going to see that the fact we have 81% of the base on unsubsidized pricing, but
only about 49% have an active loan. As people pay off the device and they keep their devices longer than just two years I expect to see that delta
in that number.

We've seen some level of BYOD, but that has leveled off over the past couple of quarters, but we expect that to continue to be part of that delta
as well. But it's actually been a pretty stable relationship over the past two or three quarters as we've largely completed the transition of the base
from subsidy to the device payment model.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

That's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call I'd like to turn it back over to Matt for some closing comments.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. During the first quarter we achieved solid financial and operational performance in a
competitive marketplace. We started the year with strong momentum in our business and expect that trend to continue as we progress throughout
the year.

We remain confident in our strategy and priorities led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining
a disciplined capital allocation model and creating value for our customers and shareholders.

We are positioning the Company for long-term growth and taking advantage of the full array of opportunities in the 5G era which is now upon us
as we move into the next cycle of growth in the industry. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and focused on building the best
network for the future to produce long-term value. Thank you for your time today.

PRESENTATION

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)

Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to
your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with Hans Vestberg, our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating
information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available
on our website.

Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements
about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may
affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP
financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial
materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year
basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period.

For the first quarter of 2019, we reported earnings of $1.22 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a net pretax benefit of $96
million related to a pension remeasurement triggered by the Voluntary Separation Program. The net impact after tax was a benefit of approximately

$71 million or $0.02 per share, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.20. This represents growth of 2.6% on an adjusted basis compared to
$1.17 a year ago.

Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the first quarter. As a reminder, at the beginning of 2018, we adopted
accounting standard, ASC 606, for revenue recognition, which results in a reduction in wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless
equipment revenue and a deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. As we discussed previously, we expect a
smaller benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the adoption of the standard, primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The
reduction in benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to consolidated earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share.

For the first quarter, the impact was a $0.03 year-over-year headwind to earnings per share. This headwind is expected to continue until the end
of 2020. In addition, as of January 1, 2019, we adopted accounting standard, ASC 842, for leases. This will primarily result in a gross-up on the
balance sheet for all operating leases. Upon adoption, we recorded approximately $22.1 billion in operating lease obligations on our consolidated
balance sheet. In addition, the lease standard affects our earnings per share, primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs. As highlighted
on our last call, we expect this impact to result in a $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter headwind on earnings per share through 2019. For the first quarter,
this headwind was $0.01 on earnings per share.

As you look at Slide 4, you can see that the 2.6% growth in adjusted EPS includes both the impacts from the deferral of commission expense related
to the revenue recognition standard and the adoption of the leasing standard. This highlights the strong underlying performance of the business.
Matt will take you through the details and key drivers later in the call. Before we do that, I'll turn the call over to Hans for his opening remarks.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and welcome, everyone, to the first earnings call in the 5G Mobility era. Once again, Verizon has led the world in the development
of new technologies with the launch of our 5G Ultra Wideband Mobility network and the Motorola 5G smartphone. We launched our first 2 cities,
Chicago and Minneapolis, and continue to deploy infrastructure in more cities, prioritizing cities that have made it easy to build there. Our initial
launches are performing as expected on a brand-new technology being deployed for the first time in the world. As more features within the network
and handsets become available for deployment through ongoing software innovation, we will provide increased coverage, improved capacity and
greater throughputs.

For our 5G Home product, we're on track to launch additional markets when new customer equipment under the global standards becomes
available in the second half of the year. This enables us to apply our learnings from the initial commercial launch in 2018 to a broader base of
customers. I'm super proud of what the Verizon team has achieved so far, and I'm pushing our teams for many more milestones and industry firsts
that will give our customers the best experience. 5G has been a huge focus for us, but it hasn't taken away from our ability to enhance and improve
the best-in-class 4G LTE network and superior customer experience. The network team continues to deploy leading technologies that improve our
customers' experience. We have 4G LTE Advanced capability in over 1,500 markets across the U.S. and continue to be recognized by third parties
for our superior network performance.

Our One Fiber deployment is rapidly expanding the multipurpose fiber network outside our landline footprint. This will enable new revenue
opportunities in the large enterprise, small business, public sector and wholesale businesses while also delivering expense reductions opportunities.
We have ramped up in installations to a run rate over 1,000 route miles per month, which puts us at the top of all major U.S. fiber providers. All of
this is being accomplished within the current levels of our CapEx guidance. We are now 2 years into the implementation of our next-generation
Intelligent Edge Network, which we expect to be largely completed by 2021. We're realizing significant efficiencies and cost savings from our
network transformation initiatives and expect the CapEx and the OpEx benefits to extend well beyond their investment period.

With our unique set of assets, including our wide portfolio of spectrum, dense fiber network architecture and software-defined networking
capabilities, Verizon remains the clear network performance leader in today's marketplace, and we're best positioned to capitalize on all the
opportunities that 5G will bring to bear. Our ambition remains to provide the most advanced, next-generation network performance in the world.
As I have said many times before, the combination of our Intelligent Edge Network and the 5G technology capabilities will deliver 8 network
currencies to our customers and open up a new world of innovation that will transform the way we work, live and play.

We're leading in the world in 5G, extending our leadership position in 4G, executing on the fundamentals and creating new ways to leverage our
vast distribution capabilities through our network-as-a-service strategy and focus our partnership and key elements in driving increased value for
our customers. Therefore, we are excited to announce we've partnered with Google to offer YouTube TV to our customers wherever they want it
and on whatever platform they choose. Our new partnership allows our widest mobility customers to take their YouTube TV with them on-the-go,
our wireless 5G Home customers to add premium content from YouTube TV to their Internet bundle and gives our consumer Fios broadband
customers even more options when it comes to content and services.

2019 is shaping up to be an exciting year for Verizon. We have started the year with a solid financial result for the first quarter, led by strong growth
in wireless service revenue and earnings per share. We're confident in the current state of our business, and we have good momentum going into
the second quarter. I'm proud of the team's flawless execution in times of so much change and transformation in the company. We have maintained
our disciplined approach to capital allocation, focused on investing in our networks, supporting a consistent dividend policy and strengthening
our balance sheet, as shown by our recently announced leverage target. We're well positioned to deliver on all of our capital allocation goals in
the years ahead. We're highly confident in our underlying business and go-to-market strategy as we now have moved to our new Verizon 2.0
structure as of 1st of April. The new structure positions us to better serve our customers and provide solutions to their needs regardless of their
underlying technology. We will begin reporting in the new structure starting with the second quarter results. With that said, I will now hand the
call over to Matt to discuss our financial results.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump in with a recap of our consolidated operating and financial results. On a reported basis, first
quarter consolidated revenue was $32.1 billion, up 1.1%. The primary driver of the increase was strong wireless service revenue growth. We are
maintaining our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage growth. On a consolidated basis, first quarter adjusted
EBITDA margin was 37.2%. This was up from 37.1% and includes the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense and the impact of the
lease accounting standard that Brady mentioned earlier. The growth in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to wireless service revenue performance
as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business. Our business excellence initiatives have produced cumulative
cash savings of $3.0 billion since the program started in 2018. At the end of the first quarter, we have completed the first 2 phases of our Voluntary
Separation Program and have realized approximately $180 million of expense savings. Roughly 60% of the savings in the first quarter is attributed
to the wireline business, with the remainder primarily in wireless. We are on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by
2021. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was up over 100 basis points versus the prior year. Last year's ETR included certain one-time benefits
due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will not repeat this year. Despite the higher tax rate, we delivered earnings growth with strong operational
performance.

Based on the strength of the operational trends in the underlying business, we are raising earnings guidance for full year 2019. We now expect low
single-digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. This is an increase from our prior
guidance, which is a 2019 adjusted EPS to be similar to 2018, excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. Our expectations regarding
the headwind impact on EPS from the new lease accounting standard remain unchanged at approximately $0.04 to $0.08 for full year 2019.

As Hans said, we are moving to the new Verizon 2.0 structure in the second quarter reporting cycle. We plan to provide recast quarterly historical
financial information for the past 9 quarters prior to reporting second quarter results, so our investors can digest the new view of our company
well in advance of our second quarter earnings report. We are committed to providing transparency in our reporting in order to help bridge the
transition to the new structure.

Now let's move on to the reviews of the operating segments, starting with wireless on Slide 7. Total wireless operating revenue increased 3.7% to
$22.7 billion in the first quarter, primarily driven by continued strong service revenue performance. We are extremely proud of our results given
the level of promotional activity in the marketplace during the quarter. Wireless service revenue increased by 4.4%, mainly due to customers
stepping up into higher-priced plans, contribution from the strong net adds late in the fourth quarter and an increase in connections per account.
The year-over-year growth rate was positively affected by a number of factors. In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the consumer migration
from traditional subsidy to device payment plans, and we moved to a longer device upgrade cycle for business customers. We anticipate that the
impact of these 2 items will be minimal going forward and expect wireless service revenue growth to be within the mid-2% to 3% range for the

remainder of the year. In the first quarter, equipment revenue decreased 2.2%, driven by the continuing extension of device ownership cycles.
Wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 47.4%. This includes headwinds of approximately 85 basis points,
primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard, as previously mentioned.

Let's now turn to Slide 8 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. Customer activity in the quarter was consistent with seasonal trends
from prior years. We maintained measured promotional actions. And our postpaid net adds totaled 61,000, consisting of phone net losses of 44,000,
tablet net losses of 156,000 and other connected device net additions of 261,000, led by wearables. Postpaid smartphone net additions were
174,000. Phone churn increased slightly during the first quarter due to the competitive nature of the marketplace. Our postpaid phone churn of
0.84% was up 4 basis points and remains strong. Our superior network quality and our personalized offerings continue to resonate with our
customers. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.12% was up compared to 1.04% last year. Total postpaid device activations, of which approximately
78% were phones, were down 4.7%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.4%, down from 5.0%. In the first quarter, prepaid net losses were 176,000
compared to a loss of 335,000 last year. We continue to focus on high-value accounts and profitability in our prepaid offerings.

Now let's move to our wireline segment on Slide 9. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.9% in the quarter as the business
continues to face secular pressures. Growth in high-quality fiber products was more than offset by pricing pressures on legacy products and
technology shifts. Consumer Markets revenue increased 0.1%, driven by the growth in Fios services. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 2.9%,
due primarily to demand for our broadband offerings. Fios Internet net adds of 52,000 were driven by continued demand for our high-quality fiber
broadband product. Fios Video losses of 53,000 resulted from continued cord-cutting trends as more customers are choosing over-the-top video
services. Our enterprise solutions, partner solutions and business markets revenues declined by 4.5%, 12.5% and 4.9%, respectively, driven by
technology shifts and pricing pressures, as mentioned earlier. Wireline segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 20.3%, which included a
meaningful contribution from our cost management initiatives, especially the Voluntary Separation Program.

Let's now move on to Slide 10 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the first quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue was $1.8 billion, which was down
7.2%. Declines in desktop advertising continue to more than offset growth in mobile and native advertising. The integration of the demand side
and supply side platform is complete, and the team is finishing the customer migration to the new consolidated platform. We continue to enhance
the features and solutions, making it easier to do business with our advertising partners, enabling us to create even more synergies across the
business. The Verizon Media Group team is focused on enhancing our super channels, driving revenue improvements in sports, finance, news,
entertainment, home and mail by deepening our customer engagement for example, during the quarter, Yahoo! Finance launched live bell-to-bell
video coverage, which is linked throughout the family of Yahoo! brands for optimal viewership.

Let's now focus on consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on Slide 11. Cash flow from operating activities was strong and totaled
$7.1 billion, an increase of about $400 million from the prior year. This was driven by the continued momentum of our operating businesses and
lower discretionary employee benefits contributions, partially offset by the first and largest of 3 payments related to our Voluntary Separation
Program. Capital spending for the first quarter was $4.3 billion, which was down approximately $300 million. Our capital expenditures continue
to support the growth in data and video traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued buildout of our 5G Ultra Wideband
network, the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint. We maintain
our full year 2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free
cash flow for the first quarter of $2.8 billion, up about $700 million.

Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to execute on our strategy. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at
low levels, giving us the confidence to operate effectively in various financial market conditions. We ended the quarter with $113.7 billion of total
gross debt, which was comprised of $103.3 billion of unsecured debt and $10.4 billion of asset-backed securitizations. As part of our commitment
to strengthening the balance sheet, we provided a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 1.75x to 2.0x at our Investor Day in February.
At the end of the first quarter, our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.1x, down from 2.4x in the first quarter of 2018.

Our progress in strengthening the balance sheet and the continued use of excess cash flow after investing in the business to further delever the
balance sheet has been recognized by the rating agencies, with both S&P and Moody's recently putting Verizon on positive outlook for a potential
upgrade in credit ratings. With that, I'll turn the call back to Hans for a summary of our strategic positioning and goals for the remainder of 2019.

APRIL 23, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Matt. As demonstrated by our strong results, we have carried forward the momentum that we saw into 2018 through the first quarter of
2019 and are focused on the execution in the Verizon 2.0. We're committed to creating great customer experiences as a result of the investment
in our networks. We're extending our leadership position in 4G, driving innovation in 5G and expanding our high-valued customer relationships
while creating value for our shareholders. We're building momentum for our Ultra Wideband 5G network. Our launch of the world's first commercial
5G smartphone signals the beginning of an era that would transform the way people live, work and play.

Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network, enabling efficiencies throughout the core
infrastructure and delivering flexibility to meet customer requirements at the network edge. We're excited about the current position in the
marketplace, our financial strength and the opportunities ahead of us. With that, I will turn the call back to Brady so we can get to your questions.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

Actually sort of 2 related questions here on mobile 5G. At your analyst meeting, you identified the key opportunity with your mobile 5G launches,
defending and growing your market share. And so it was actually interesting to see that the first mobile offer was actually priced a little bit higher
than your 4G offering. And so that implies it's a little bit more of an ARPU driver. So the first question is, as we sort of watch more 5G deployments
going forward, what success factor do you think investors should be focusing on? Is it going to be subscriber metrics responding favorably or ARPU
or ARPA metrics responding favorably? And then just the second part of this, and this is something Hans alluded to earlier, which is that some of
the initial reviews of the launch have noted that this is still an early-stage technology. And so the question is, when should investors expect some
of the technical adjustments to be ironed out, so that you can scale your mobile 5G offering in a way that will deliver a more consistent user
experience?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brett Feldman. If we start with the mobile 5G, as we said before, we see, of course, an opportunity when we're early on the customer
experience like 5G, you have a chance. And we have high ambitions here to see that we can grow with subscribers, but, again, we're very early
stage on 5G. I mean, we're absolutely the first in the world. At the same time, of course, we will see that we have an offering that responds to the
enhanced sort of technology and experience you will get from 5G. So that's what you saw on the first commercial offerings we did on the 5G Moto.
We will soon as well announce earlier come with our next phone, and that we're going to discuss or announce how we're going to deal with that.
But clearly, the team has high ambition in this area. We think that our leadership and experience is giving us a way to monetize 5G for mobility.
When it comes to the initial launch on the mobility in Minneapolis and Chicago, it meets our expectation, what we have seen from the software.
Remember this, we are first in the world to adjust from all the way from the network, to the chipset, to the handset and actually have an experience,
and we have a great experience out there already right now in the Moto model, basically constantly updates on the software improving the
throughput, the speeds and all of that and features. And of course, we're part of driving the improvements on 5G in the world and giving our
customers the first experience. So I would say that I'm really excited on what I have seen so far. It's meeting our expectations, but we have much

more to come out from when it comes to speed, throughput, coverage and all of that from the deployment on our Ultra Wideband 5G. And then
not forgetting that we also as well said so many times before, when we launched 4G, we didn't even know about carrier aggregration, which, of
course, changed the whole game on 4G LTE Advanced, which we now enjoy 1,500 -- more than 1,500 markets on that, and that will happen with
5G as well. And one of the most important features that I haven't talked about is, of course, the dynamic spectrum sharing that will come during
next year, where you basically also can use deploy wherever you are with 5G, and then you don't need to allocate certain spectrum to certain
technology. So I see a lot of technology innovation, and we work with the most advanced partners in the world here to actually stay in the lead.

Operator

The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Maybe one for Hans and one for Matt. Hans, can you give us any learnings you have on the -- for the 5G Home deployment? And I realize you're
working with pre-standards equipment and expect that equipment to be available later this year. Can you talk about the benefits that you'll see
maybe in terms of capabilities, installation and form factor when you get that new standards-based equipment? And then maybe one for Matt. On
the wireless side, it looked like the cost of service was a bit elevated this quarter, and then had the impact on margins. Is that all being driven by
the lease accounting? Or was there something sort of underlying operational issues that's driving that?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

If I thought, and as you rightly pointed out, the first deployment of 5G Home that we did last year was based on our own proprietary of standard.
And thus, it was limited and now development on the software. However, what we have seen is, of course, a consistent speed, keeping up 300
megabits per second minimum to our customers, which is great to see. Second, of course, the installation times has been reduced significantly
since the beginning. So we have great, lot of learnings when we come out in the second half of this year when we have CPs on the global standard
for 5G Home. And again, it's sort of a multi-deployment, so it's the same equipment doing mobility and Home. So with all improvements we're
going to see on 5G Mobility, it's going to go to 5G Home as well with the software. So a lot of great learnings, especially on the coverage, installation
times, and then keeping the consistent on the speeds, which has been very good.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

John, so on your question around wireless margins, so we reported 47.4%. But as you touched on in your question, there was some year-over-year
noise from the accounting, both the deferred commission expense coming from revenue recognition and the lease accounting, about 85 basis
points on there. So that's showing up in both the cost of sales and SG&A lines. But when you -- so when you adjust for that, the 47.4% gets you to
about 48.3%. So up year-over-year, 47.8% a year ago. So nice improvement on the margin year-over-year, which, when combined with the 4.4%
service revenue growth, means that we think we had a very good earnings quarter in wireless -- high quality of earnings there and really setting
the basis for the year as a whole.

APRIL 23, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

A follow-up and a question. First, Hans, can you give us an update on the 5G equipment pipeline and the potential timing for NR volumes as well
as the impact to CapEx base? And then second, with leverage now in the low-2s, can you talk about strategic priorities beyond the current business?
Could you envision making a strategic acquisition this year?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So first about when it comes to the ecosystem of handsets, et cetera, I think that, as was alluded during our Investor Day, we see a majority of the
handsets coming out next year having the millimeter wave spectrum. Many of the phones, as already I've talked about, meaning the Samsung
phone, both the Note and the Galaxy coming this year, we'll both have it 5G. We have the Moto already. We're going to see also an LG phone
coming out. So we see a much quicker ramp-up on ecosystem in that area to be clear. At the same time, the whole ecosystem from chipsets to
equipment is ramping up quickly. But again, we are in the forefront of technology here. So of course, we are being on the edge of the demands
and the supply on equipment at the moment. But we feel good about that. Secondly, the question around our capital allocation. We remain very
solid in what we have said before. I mean, number one, we invest in our business; number two, we see that we can serve the dividend to our
shareholders; and thirdly, then we have our targets that Matt talked about on the balance sheet. That's really where we have the main focus. Then
we talked at the Investor Day, there could be tuck-ins, et cetera, but nothing else in that at the moment.

Operator

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Matt, maybe you can just talk about the wireless service revenues. The ARPA was strong this quarter. I think you mentioned people moving to
higher-priced plans. So where are you on Unlimited adoption and the spread across those plans? How much headroom do you have on that? And
then perhaps on the network, can you just talk about the refarming of the 3G spectrum and where you are on that process, particularly in the major
markets?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Simon. So as you look at the wireless service revenues, you see the 4.4% was a good result in the first quarter. As we look at that, the ARPA was
a big piece of it. We continue to step customers up to Unlimited, which is typically a step-up in their ARPA. We continue to add connections per
account, and we think we still have the runway to do so. Unlimited is still less than 50% of our total connections, so there's runway there to continue
that. And that's why you heard, as we made the comment on the prepared remarks, that we see service revenue for the balance of the year continuing
to be in the mid-2s to 3% range. So continued growth on a year-over-year basis as we look forward.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

On the spectrum, I think that, first of all, where the team has continued to do excellent, as I said, we still are gaining the majority of all the performance
metrics in the markets. So the team is doing good work. And when it comes to the refarming all the 3G spectrum, we have said that's going to be
ended by 2020, and we are on plan for doing that. And the team is working every day to see that we are doing most out of our spectrum.

APRIL 23, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

Maybe 2, if I could. Just Matt, the -- on the -- sorry, the cost structure for the income statement on the dividend side -- sorry, the depreciation side,
we saw a step-down of about $100 million there into the New Year, with the big step-up in kind of CapEx in the quarter. So if you could kind of
address how depreciation is changing and contributing to the guidance. And then the second piece was just on the media side and, I guess,
corporate and other. If we look at the combined number that we back into by comparing the segments to the consolidated total, it looks like we
had a step-up in losses there. Could you kind of talk about the profitability in that unit or if there are other things that are moving around in the
corporate side not related to the media business?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So thanks, David. So on the depreciation amortization side, a couple of things in there. One, you've obviously got the impact of the lease
accounting standards. So some items that would would've flowed through D&A will now flow through above the line. And so that's part of it. The
other pieces is the mix of our spend over the last year or so has moved to a mix of assets with a longer average life. It means they're depreciated
over a longer time period. So that kind of impacts the timing of how they come through on the depreciation line of the income statement. On the
C&O side, as you look at that number, you're right that there's a little uptick in the negative results in that piece. And where that's coming from,
there's 2 or 3 one-timers in the first quarter. They weren't large enough for us to adjust out. But net-net, they had about a $0.02 impact at the EBITDA
line. So you see that flowing through there. They're one-timers. You shouldn't expect to see them through the rest of the year. And so you've got
strength in the overall results of the business, in the wireless and wireline segments, being offset by those one-timers that I say add up to about
$0.02 of EPS pressure that's sitting in C&O. So it's related to one-timers rather than Verizon Media Group that's driving that number in C&O.

Operator

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

I wonder if you could just comment on what you've learned about high-frequency spectrum. The work that we did on the Sacramento market and
then some of the press reports of your rollout of mobility in Chicago in particular and then -- and with some of the comments are -- were yesterday
from T-Mobile's Neville Ray all sort of point at millimeter wave having real challenges for propagation. I'm wondering how you think about millimeter
wave in the context of your broader rollout at this point of 5G, particularly for mobility, and what role you think mid-band needs to play in that
rollout.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Craig. So when it comes to the millimeter wave, as I said before, I mean, that has lived up to our expectation on performance. And again,
we're very early on in improving the software, how we can deal with it. We all need to remind ourselves this is not a coverage spectrum because
we will do it as far as the economic is sustainable, of course. But still, it's very good, the ranges we can come up with. And, of course, the throughput
and speeds are enormous. And again, we're very early on, on the journey. I think that no one else in the whole industry knows more than Verizon
about it. We have been onto this for 2 years, and what we have seen on it is a good strategy. And topping that, which I've said before, the dynamics
sort of spectrum sharing will be the next step for us to see that we have all the assets to deploy our strategy on 5G to meet the different type of
use cases we outlined at the Investor Day sort of the mobility case, the 5G Home case and the mobile edge compute case. So that's what we're
working with every day here to improve, et cetera. So the engineering team feels good about it.

Operator

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD and U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Just 2, if I could. First, if you look at the 5G rollout for the Home, I think, initially, you were advertising to offer over several hundred megabits per
second of speed to the consumer. And more recently, we've learned that you've been trialing an over-100 megabit product. And I'm curious how
that change in throughput affects the potential coverage in homes over time or the speed that you might be able to reach that initial 30 million
home target, if that would accelerate the pace of the rollout. And then just following up on the comments around the partnership with YouTube
TV, what are your thoughts on potentially exiting the Fios Video business and letting someone like a YouTube TV or another partner just potentially
manage that video business for you, so you can just really focus on the broadband and the infrastructure side of the equation?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks. Okay. Rightfully mentioned, we started with 300 megabits per second in our offering in the cities. Of course, we have said that we will sort
of meet all the customer demands. And that's why we, of course, are trialing out different type of speeds as well. And as you rightfully said, I mean,
if you have an enormous speed and throughput, of course, the range of coverage will go out and go further. But again, we need to meet the
customer demands in the markets where we're into. And the team will run down, will see that we are competitive in every marketplace we go. But
of course, you can see possibilities for having different ranges of speeds on 5G Home as well. But we're not there yet. We will come in the second
half of this year and see what offerings going to have. On the YouTube TV, I think that what's most important is that we are committed to support
our customers with the optionality. Here, we're creating, as we said from the beginning when we decided not to pursue our own investment in
OTT, that we will have partners in order to work out our strategy network and networking strategy and give our customers optionality. And that
goes also for our Fios customers. And there, YouTube TV will play a role for us.

Operator

The next question is from Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director

Just 2, if I could. One, on wireless, I think you called out some pleasantness with the churn levels, given the promotional activity in the quarter. So
maybe if you could just talk about what you saw in the quarter, how that compared relative to expectations in typical 1Q seasonality. And then
secondly, just to go back to the question on YouTube. What's exactly changing on the mobility side? Is this just an ability for your mobile customers
to watch YouTube on their phones? Or is there any sort of incentivization on the mobile side using YouTube as well?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Matt. So on the wireless churn, the -- we saw what we would normally expect from a volume standpoint in 1Q, with a typical dropoff from
the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We saw a fair amount of competitive activity in the first quarter, and we really didn't participate in that until
we got into the March time period, when we start to see volumes pick up. We feel good about the momentum we have in the business as we exited
first quarter, as we come into second quarter and expect to see that drive performance for the rest of the year. On the YouTube TV, I think as you
described and you heard Hans say, gives us the opportunity to combine that product with the core wireless offering. And Ronan and his team will
make sure that's relevant to our wireless mobility customers having that additional functionality available to them.

The next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst

Two questions, if I may, for Matt. First one is on EPS guidance increase. Just curious how much of that you're anticipating coming from the operational
businesses, so said differently, showing up in the EBITDA line item versus improvements that you're expecting below the line, such as interest
expense, taxes or other income. I saw, for example, other income was $295 million or about a $0.06 benefit in the first quarter at least that we
weren't anticipating in our model. And then secondly, as it relates to the savings from the VSP program, you mentioned $180 million to date. And
you've -- I'm just curious, how much of that or how much more can we expect for the remainder of the year? And I guess, as part of that, where can
wireline margins go for this year? Would you anticipate them continuing to go higher?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Colby. So I'll start with your second question. So as you think about the VSP savings in the first quarter, we said approximately 10,000
V teamers were leaving the organization as a whole. Around half of those came off at the end of December. So you had a full quarter impact from
those. The second tranche was at the end of March, so really minimal impact from those. So as you think, when you get to a full run rate, is going
to be significantly higher than that $180 million. 2Q will be a blend. It'll be more than the 5,000, but not the full 10,000. It'll really be 3Q when you
get to a full run rate benefit compared to the $180 million that we saw in 1Q. And as you say, more than -- approximately 60% of that benefit came
from the -- in the wireline segment. And so we expect to see that continue to help wireline margins for the year as a whole. So we think that, that
will be something that will be a positive as you think about managing the cost in that business to offset some of the trends on the revenue line. In
terms of the EPS guidance, so I want to just want to make sure that we level-set where we were. We wanted to make sure we kept it in the same
basis as last time. Last time, we said that the adjusted EPS before the impact of the leasing standard would be similar to last year. Last year's $4.71.
And so we said adjusting the guidance to be low single digits up. And to be clear, even after accounting for the new leasing standard, that would
put us in the mid-4.70s from an adjusted EPS standpoint. And when you think about what's in there, you've got the headwind from the lease
accounting standard. You've also got the impact of the commission expense deferral under the revenue recognition. And our expectation of those
impacts are the same as we outlined previously. So what we certainly think, and Brady talked you through this in the prepared remarks, when you
look at the first quarter results, we're up $0.03 year-over-year all in from an adjusted EPS standpoint. That included $0.04 of pressure from the
accounting. And in addition to that, the ETR year-over-year was up about 100 basis points. So that year-over-year increase in the underlying earnings
of the business was strong. And you touched on one piece of that. Certainly, the benefit of VSP -- the Voluntary Separation Program was helpful
in that. But when you look at the wireless business, and you see that 4.4% service revenue growth and you see the EBITDA margin when you adjust
for the impact of the accounting over 48%, we feel very strong about the operational performance of the business on a good growth on a
year-over-year basis. And we have good momentum coming out to the first quarter and as we head into the rest of the year. So that was the reason
for the change in guidance.

Operator

The next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners.

Michael McCormack - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Telecommunications Senior Analyst

Matt, maybe just a quick comment on the wireline revenue side. How much of any we saw from an FX perspective headwind, and then maybe if
you can try to bifurcate between the competitive landscape versus technology migration? And then, I guess, I'll beat the YouTube TV one more
time. Just sort of thinking about -- and maybe this is for Hans. As you think about the synthetic double-play economics for consumers, it doesn't
appear, at least on paper from what I've seen, that there's a significant discount you're offering. Maybe we haven't seen everything yet, but sort of
the rack rate of $50 a month for YouTube TV, plus a naked broadband or stand-alone broadband product, how do you think about those economics?

And how competitive will that be against current double-play offers, and, I guess, also the risk of cannibalization of the current Fios TV customer
base?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. So on your question around the wireline revenue, there was a little bit of headwind from the FX, primarily in the enterprise space,
but they didn't offset the ongoing pressures that we see from the technology shifts. So we would expect some of those trends to continue as we
go through the quarter. We certainly expect the partner solutions revenue trend to improve versus the number we saw in 1Q, but still be negative
on a year-over-year basis. But we are continuing to expand the offerings that we have across the wireline business based off fiber-based products
and newer technologies. Those are continuing to grow as we go forward and offset and decline in legacy products. And in addition to that, wireline
revenue has opportunities as a result of our fiber build. We're able to offer our services to small medium business, to enterprise, to even on a
wholesale partner basis, in geographies that we historically haven't. So that will bring some incremental revenue opportunities to our wireline
customer base in addition to what we're doing with new products as we move forward.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

When it comes to the YouTube TV and what we offered in our initial 5G Home launch, that was sort of a stand-alone offering. This is -- what we're
doing right now, we're doing an overall agreement with YouTube TV to offer to our home and mobility and Fios customers. And the final commercials
we have not decided yet, but, clearly, we will do a competitive offering for our customers, but we're also creating the optionality for our customers
to get YouTube TV. And again, it comes back to our main strategy that we are focusing on doing the network. We're doing the platform and we're
doing the integration, but we're not taking sort of the investments of TV platform, nor for the content. We see that is our role in this ecosystem.
And remember, we have the best distribution, the best network and a great brand. And that's what can attract a partnership like with YouTube TV.
So that's a little bit different thinking.

Operator

Your last question will come from Walter Piecyk of BTIG.

Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Co-Head of Research and MD

Two questions. First, I want to go back to Craig's question. Hans, you mentioned that millimeter wave's not your coverage spectrum. I think that's
a little different than what you guys have talked about before. So maybe we can talk about that dynamic spectrum sharing. Can you talk specifically
about what -- when next year that would be available, which spectrum bands you would be putting the 5G NR on in order to enable that for
coverage? And then, Craig, on the -- going back to Hodulik's question on the expenses because I kind of got lost with all those numbers. I'm not
sure what you're referring to on the 42%, 47%. If we just look at network expense and SG&A as your aggregate OpEx for wireless, it's up 10%
year-on-year. How much of that is -- has to do with this commission accounting? And is this the kind of run rate, particularly in the SG&A side, that
we should expect going forward each quarter? Or is there some kind of one-time impacts on just the overall level of this OpEx, particularly in SG&A?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

If I start with the first question there, I don't think we have changed anything about what we thought about millimeter wave, how we're going to
deploy that. And we're deploying massively at the moment. Remember, the majority of all the traffic is in dense urban areas, where we now initially
are focusing, of course, getting an even greater experience for our customers in the 5G experience -- the real 5G experience. At the same time, we
get the owners economics of having the best spectrum position there. When it comes to dynamic spectrum sharing and which spectrum we're
going to use, et cetera, and when it will come into play. It will come into play next year. Right now, we're in discussion. But of course, it's going to
be whatever low band you want to have, mid-band and high band. That's how it works. But over time, all of the spectrum will be sort of exposed
to dynamic spectrum sharing. The good thing is for being a leader like Verizon, we can impact on the ecosystem how this will be done, and that's

why we are in discussions with the chipset manufacturers and the equipment manufacturers to have the best solution, and, again, using the
engineering skills of the Verizon team.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Walt, on the wireless margin, the reported number was 47.4%, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. There was 85 basis points of
pressure from the combination of the 2 new accounting standards, but the vast majority of that pressure came from the deferred commission
expense. So as you think about the language we've used over the past few quarters related to the revenue recognition standard, you had the
benefit last year. And then we said you'd have year-over-year headwinds in both '19 and '20 as you --- until you get to a run rate on the amortization
of those commission expenses being close to the actual cash expense upfront. So about 85 points of pressure, a lot of that's showing up in the
SG&A line, as you point out. And that will continue throughout the year to a varying degree. In addition to that, we did have a little bit of change
in shaping of the advertising spending in wireless over the course of the year, a little more in 1Q this year than last year. I expect that will equal
itself out over the course of the year as a whole. But the big impact was the impact of the deferred commission expense. So that's why we called
out the 85 basis points, so that you can get to 48.3% from the 47.4% and compare that year-over-year. And you see that wireless margins on a
like-for-like basis actually grew year-over-year on an increase in revenue. So we think very strong quality of earnings within wireless in first quarter.

Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Co-Head of Research and MD

Got it. The confusion is, I think a lot of people look at margins on the service revenue as kind of a more appropriate way to look at margins, which
appear to be down. There's total revenue with equipment is -- I mean, does your operating margins really have anything to do with equipment?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Not significant, but that's why we put the -- made sure the 85 basis points was in the commentary, so that we give people a little more transparency
and do the comparison year-over-year. So hopefully that helps.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Okay, thanks. That's all the time we have for questions. Before we the end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Hans for some closing comments.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Brady. Thanks, Matt. Just to sum up, I mean, the 5G era is here, and we're positioning the company for long-term growth by taking advantage
of the full array of opportunities it has to offer. I think during the first quarter, again, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in a
competitive marketplace. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities, led by building the best network, creating platforms to further monetize
data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model and creating value for our customers and shareholders. By that, I would like to thank
you all for attending this call today, and have a great day.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, everyone.

Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

PRESENTATION

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being
recorded. (Operator Instructions)

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website.
A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.

Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements
about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may
affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.

This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and
during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported
first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.4 billion, including a loss on spectrum licenses related to Auction

103 of $1.2 billion and a net charge of $182 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liability. Excluding the effects of these
special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.26 in the first quarter, up 5% compared to $1.20 a year ago.

Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our first quarter earnings profile. We expect 2020 to be the final year that the adoption of
accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition will have a material year-over-year impact on our income statement. As we illustrated in
previous quarters, we realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 during the first quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to
the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported and adjusted earnings
per share, which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.03 for the quarter.

For full year 2020, we expect headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09. We estimate there was a negative
$0.04 net impact included in the reported and adjusted EPS from COVID during the quarter. Matt will go through this in more detail later. Adjusted
EPS growth of 5% over the prior year, illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide, reflects the strong underlying performance of the business, partially
offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to walk you through a recap of the actions we have taken during this unprecedented time.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and most welcome to this earnings call. This is an earnings call that is very different from all previous ones that I have done. I've
been in crisis -- in the telecom crisis in 2000, bank crisis in 2008 and '09. This is something totally different. It's a health crisis with a pandemic that
impacts each and every one of us wherever you are in this world.

I'm proud of the team of Verizon, how we have been stacking up in this crisis and how we work together. We decided very early on to split our
team, in our crisis management team, and the leadership team continue to drive our business forward. In the middle of February, we made that
split in order to see that we're actually attending all the things that happening in a company the size of Verizon.

Our COVID-19 response has been based on how we manage our 4 stakeholders. We have taken decisive action, but they're all balanced and thinking
about the long-term and positive impact for all our stakeholders. Let me quickly go over what we have done in different areas of stakeholders.

On the employee side, the majority of our all employees are working from home. We moved quickly to a work-from-home environment. Today,
we have high productivity in that setup. We have also retrained some 20,000 of our own employees to work with new tasks and work from home.
And some additional 1,000 of third parties that is part of our delivery.

But also, we need to acknowledge we have a lot of our employees in frontline, serving customers, keeping up the networks, at the same time as
keeping some of our stores open. We have roughly 30% of our stores open, of course, with limited opening times and also only by appointment.
But they are playing a vital role to keep up the most important infrastructure in this country right now, besides hospitals and first responders, and
I'm happy to report the team is doing a great job.

And talking about our customers, we have been attending all our customers with new demands during this crisis. At the same time, we are also
part of the pledge of Keep Americans Connected, which means that we are waiving late fees or overages for small and medium businesses and
the residential customers that have been impacted by the coronavirus.

Our network has performed well. I will come back to that a little bit later.

When it comes to our work in the society, helping communities, that's also extremely important right now. Large corporations need to take the
responsibility. We have done some of it, like the PayItForward, which is our concert twice, sometimes 3 times a week, which is gathering concerts
or celebrities, bringing in people actually adding to and helping small and medium businesses. We call it PayItForward LIVE. But also work with
WHO and other organization that needs help and ultimately supporting the most vulnerable in our society.

APRIL 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Finally, on the education side, that we always have been focused on, we're not only supporting the schools that had already had their support for,
but we're also adding together New York Times, offering all the content from New York Times to all the high school students across the country.
So we're proud what we're doing in that area.

And finally, on the financials, we have also worked quite a lot with what we're doing in our cost side. We're taking already cost measurements in
the first quarter, everything from third-party spending, seeing, of course, that we're traveling less but we're doing this prudently as usual. On top
of that, we increased the CapEx guidance in the quarter because we felt that it was a good time for us to continue to see that we have robust
networks as we went into a moment in time we don't really know how the network would be used. At the same time, of course, sending a message
that we think is a good return on investment on that incremental CapEx. At the same time, I think Matt and his team has done a great job of seeing
that our balance sheet is in the best shape, added liquidity in the middle of the quarter through very cost-effective bond costs that we had.

And we are also working with scenario planning. Nobody really knows how this is going to end, but we have several scenarios and actions that
we're working with as a leadership team.

Let me talk about the network a little bit, and we have been reporting every week the development of our network since the outbreak of the
pandemic. And you are seeing some staggering numbers, like over 200% up on gaming, 10x up on collaboration tools, 40% up on video. 800 million
calls a day, which is twice the amount of what we have on Mother's Day, which is the biggest day a year. All that we have been managing very well
with the network. We have built a robust network, and we can deliver high quality.

If we then look now week-to-week, you can see on the slide that we have much less of changes. We feel that we have settled in on the type of
usage of the network and where it's used. So it's very small variation.

I just want to point out the mobile handoffs, which is basically how our customers are moving between different cells, down 35% since the outbreak
of the COVID-19. And in certain places like New York City, it's over 50% reductions on mobile handoff.

So how our network hold up then when it comes to all those changes? This is how we showed during the Investor Day, the -- how our capacity
versus the busy hours in the wireless network. As you can see, we continue to keep the same headroom in the network when we come into the
COVID-19. And the main reason is that, first of all, we were prepared. We have added capacity. But also the network is using different time frames
and with different applications. And this exclude any use of the AWS-3 temporary spectrum that FCC so greatly lent to us in the beginning of this
crisis as an insurance if usage would go somewhere we wouldn't know. But however, I can report that our technicians and our operations team
has done a fantastic job, and the network is keeping up very well with the changes and the enormous usage of the network.

Let me just finish up before I hand over to Matt and talking about the progress towards our 2020 commitment. They are intact. We work to see
that we can both handle this crisis, which is unprecedented, but we also continue to execute on our strategy. When it comes to strengthen our
core business and grow our core business, of course, we, right now, have more digital sales than we had before, which is, of course, very encouraging.
But we also strengthened our core business by adding a very good and nice piece of millimeter wave spectrum that gives us very good holdings
for fortified strategy.

When it comes to leverage our assets, and we're growing in the future, our 5G plans and our fiber plans, the build out of that are on plan. We were
also a little bit ahead of plan when we ended the first quarter. And can I report still today, we are on plan with the 5G and fiber. Of course, our
challenge is out there when it comes to COVID-19 and so on. But our team are finding new ways and innovative ways to actually do the deployment.
There are ways of dealing with approvals from the municipalities set by new ways. And we have great collaborations from many of the municipalities
to do it. There might be problems going forward, but I am also confident that my team are very innovative in the field and see that we continue
to drive hard on this.

We also added an acquisition just recently, the BlueJeans acquisition, adding to what Matt and I said in the fourth quarter, talking about the
investment we want to do in our Verizon Business Group, where we see great opportunity and, of course, then accentuated in this COVID-19 where
we now add the BlueJeans capabilities, both to our existing distribution, but also for the future of 5G, where we think there are video capabilities

that's going to be extremely important. On the financial discipline, we continue to drive that. Matt is leading that work, both preplanning and what
we're doing.

And finally, about our purpose-driven company, which is so important this time to see that you have all your employees with you. We are doing a
lot of impact in the society. We have virtual volunteering right now, where a lot of our employees can actually contribute to the society in these
tough times. And finally, we also actually communicate with our employees basically every day on a live webcast in order to see that everyone
knows what we're doing and where we're going in times of uncertainty.

Quickly, on the first quarter. Matt will cover it much better. I'm proud of the team, delivering strong growth in wireless service revenue but also the
5% growth on our adjusted earnings, which includes impact of COVID-19 and then a strong cash flow, up 26% year-over-year. The segments all
had their challenges, but also their strength in this quarter. Mainly, the challenges come from COVID-19.

Finally, on the guidance, we decided to continue to do certain guidance, even there are certain unclarities in the market and of the future. We
decided that revenue, we will not guide on the revenue because the hardware is so hard to predict at this moment. But we actually are guiding on
EPS and continue with all other items as well. And Matt will go through that in detail, but always with the understanding that we don't have all the
knowledge what will going to happen. We may need to make assumptions about it.

By that, I hand it over to Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. As Hans discussed, we are in an unprecedented time. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19
crisis and the various measures taken to address the emergency, we experienced starkly different trends during the first 2.5 months of the first
quarter than we did during the last few weeks. We understand that most of you are more interested in what we are currently seeing in the business,
so I'll go through the quarterly results at a high level and spend more time addressing the most recent trends and how they impact our expectations
for the second quarter and the full year.

We will begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results. In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $31.6
billion, down 1.6%. Growth in wireless service revenue in both the Consumer and Business segments was offset by sharp reductions in equipment
revenue. Consolidated wireless equipment revenue was down over 16% in the first quarter, driven by the Consumer segment, primarily as a result
of the limited in-store customer engagement in March due to COVID. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 billion, down slightly from last year, including
the impact from COVID. Low wireless volumes in Consumer Group drove benefits to margins through decreased promotional spend, lower
equipment revenue and improved churn. These benefits were more than offset by higher bad debt expense, lower advertising revenues from
Verizon Media Group in March and customer actions that resulted in a decrease in wireless fees and nonrecurring usage charges. Our incremental
bad debt reserve of $228 million was the largest component of these items.

The headwinds from the deferral of commission expense, that Brady highlighted earlier, reduced EBITDA by $172 million, which is an impact of
approximately 55 basis points to EBITDA margin in the quarter. We have continued to focus on our Business Excellence program, with the goal to
realize $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by the end of 2021 and have saved $6.3 billion through the end of the first quarter. The activities of
this program over the past 2 years have put us in a position to be more agile and adaptive in uncertain times like these.

Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $1.26, up 5.0% from $1.20 a year ago. This included an estimated net impact from COVID of approximately
$0.04, primarily driven by an increase of our bad debt reserve.

Let's now turn to our segment results, starting with Consumer Group on Slide 10. Our Consumer team continues to deliver best-in-class services
to our customers while keeping them connected in their personal and work communities. We are extremely proud of the team's performance,
particularly our frontline workers' efforts to meet our customers' needs during this very difficult period. Our Consumer segment started the year
with typical low seasonal volumes during the first quarter. In March, customer transaction activity slowed significantly due to shelter-in-place

policies, travel restrictions and other measures taken to promote social distancing. Later in the call, I will go into a deeper discussion on the exit
rate trends as we serve our customers in this new environment.

First quarter phone gross adds were down nearly 13% year-over-year, and postpaid phone net losses were just over 300,000 for the quarter. Phone
churn performance was solid throughout the quarter at 0.77%, which was down 4 basis points from a year ago. Consistent with first quarter seasonal
volume activity and the impact of COVID, our retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low during the quarter and is one of the key contributing
factors to the decline in wireless equipment revenue. We expect this trend to continue for as long as social distancing policies and other safety
measures to protect our employees and customers continue to limit store traffic.

Fios Internet net additions of 59,000 were up sequentially and year-over-year as work from home, in-home schooling and other related measures
increased the utility and demand for our high-quality broadband offerings. Fios video net losses accelerated for the quarter, and we expect cord
cutting trends to continue. In order to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, while providing critical network services, we have modified
our approach over the past few weeks and are not currently entering customer locations, except for critical functions.

Now let's move to Slide 11 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Our Consumer segment entered 2020 with strong momentum as we
added a significant number of wireless connections towards the end of 2019, which favorably impacted the first quarter. For our Fios consumer
products, we launched new Mix & Match pricing early in the quarter, providing price transparency and choice in our broadband and video offerings.
We also introduced Yahoo Mobile to expand our wireless offerings across our digital media customer base. We continue to generate strong service
revenue and other revenue growth. But this was more than offset by a significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to low volume
activity.

Consumer segment total revenue was down 1.7% year-over-year. The growth in unlimited plans, increase in connections per account and high
demand for our broadband services in the quarter drove strong profitability for the segment, offset by an increase in bad debt expense as a result
of COVID impacts. Consumer EBITDA margin of 46.4% was up 60 basis points over the prior year and included approximately 80 basis points of
headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Lower equipment revenue had a limited impact on our overall EBITDA performance.

Now let's move to Slide 12 to review the Business Group results. During a time when connectivity is providing critical support to those impacted
by this crisis, our Business team is at the forefront to serve our enterprise, small and medium business, public sector and wholesale customers. We
remain an outstanding partner for first responders, health care providers and other frontline workers. And as Hans mentioned, we are extremely
proud of our team's work to deliver essential services to our customers so they can serve others. Business trends were strong throughout the
quarter, and we saw heightened demand for our products and services in March. Businesses need our services now more than ever, as we saw
strong demand for mobility, Jetpacks, VPN services and high-speed circuit capacity in the first quarter.

As you look at the detail on the slide for wireless products, you can see phone gross adds were up 25% from the prior year, driven by strength in
global enterprise and public sector, with offsetting pressure in small and medium business. This contributed to postpaid phone net adds of 239,000
and total postpaid net adds of 475,000. Business segment phone churn of 1.02% in the quarter was flat year-over-year, driven by strength in public
sector, with offsetting pressure in small and medium business.

Let's now move to Slide 13 to review the business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment in the first quarter were
down approximately 0.5% from the prior year. Wireless revenues within enterprise, SMB and public sector were up year-over-year, driven by strong
wireless service revenue growth of 6.9%. This was offset by legacy wireline and wholesale revenue declines. We are encouraged by the business
EBITDA performance in the first quarter, which was driven by tight controls around spending and strong wireless performance as we generated
solid profitability, even with higher-than-usual volumes and the ongoing transformation investments in the segment for future growth.

Now let's move on to Slide 14 to discuss Verizon Media Group. During the first quarter, Verizon Media Group's performance was impacted by COVID,
similar to others in the digital advertising and search business. Total revenue is $1.7 billion, down 4% compared to last year, driven almost entirely
by COVID impacts. Prior to COVID, our year-over-year revenue trends were continuing the steady improvement seen in 2019. We are seeing increased
levels of customer engagement across our platforms. But advertising rates and search revenue have declined in the current environment.

APRIL 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Verizon Media launched a coronavirus hub on Yahoo! News and Yahoo! Finance and COVID-19's newsletter through Yahoo Mail, both of which are
driving significant customer engagement as we aim to keep users informed on what is happening in their area and around the globe with trusted
content.

Let's now move to Slide 15 for a quick look at the overall wireless performance. Slide 15 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined
wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segment for the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue grew 1.9% over the
prior year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and our supplemental earnings release's schedules on our
website.

Now let's review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on Slide 16. Cash flow from operating activities was $8.8 billion, an increase of
$1.7 billion from the prior year. This year-over-year growth was partially driven by Voluntary Separation Program payments and the voluntary
pension contributions in the first quarter of 2019 that did not repeat this year as well as working capital improvements from our operations this
quarter. Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $5.3 billion, which is up approximately $1 billion year-over-year. We expect the timing of
capital spending to be more front-end loaded than it was last year. Our capital expenditures continue to support capacity for unprecedented traffic
growth across our networks while we continue to deploy more fiber and add additional cell sites to support our 5G rollout.

As we mentioned earlier in March, we increased our full year 2020 CapEx guidance to $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion in order to facilitate Verizon's
network activity and help support the economy during this period of disruption. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.6 billion, which was up 26.2%
year-over-year and continues to fund our dividend. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with very low unsecured bond maturities through
the end of 2021. Our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.1x, up slightly from year-end.

Let's move on to Slide 17 to take a deeper look at the trends we have seen in the last half of March and into early April. During the month of March,
as COVID safety measures were implemented with new federal and state recommendations for social distancing, our retail consumer and small
business activity diminished significantly. By the middle of March, we saw a dramatic shift in customer behavior as stores closed and other business
activity halted across the country. At the same time, we experienced increased demand from our public sector and some large enterprise customers
to support frontline crisis responders, new work from home and home schooling arrangements and other demands for critical connectivity services.

This slide provides selected metrics from March 15 through April 15 and offers a more in-depth view of the early impacts of the current COVID
environment. At this point, it is unclear how long these trends will continue.

In our Consumer Group, we closed nearly 70% of our company-operated retail stores and reduced in-store services throughout the day for social
distancing safety measures. As you can see on this slide, we experienced a significant drop in customer activity and device volumes during this
period. Consumer wireless gross adds declined nearly 50% from the same period in the prior year, and upgrades declined over 40%. As expected,
lower customer switching across the entire industry has led to a significant improvement in phone churn.

As part of the industry's effort to help customers, we signed the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge in March and will waive any late fees and
keep customers connected in the event of nonpayment due to the pandemic for the period of the pledge. We have added 15 gigabits of data to
metered consumers and small business plans and also to hotspot usage for unlimited plans. This additional data, along with increased in-home
WiFi usage, has resulted in lower data overage revenue in the quarter. In addition to these customer-focused actions and impacts, consumer
behavior has changed dramatically over this short time period, such as reduced international roaming revenue.

In order to keep our employees and customers safe through social distancing, we are generally not performing installations for consumer Fios
when work inside the home would be required. Gross adds are currently limited to those that can be performed directly by the customer or with
the technician working outside the home.

In our Business group, we have broken out the trends for our small and medium business customer group, showing the drop-off that we have seen
in gross adds and upgrades as a major portion of small businesses have seen a steep reduction in activities and, in many cases, a full shutdown. In
contrast to Consumer, we are not seeing the same improvement in churn at this time.

APRIL 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

For public sector and some global enterprise customers, we have seen an increased demand for remote connectivity solutions as a greater number
of people are working and schooling from home. Wireless gross adds for these customers were up 163% over the similar period in the prior year,
mostly driven by demand for phones, Jetpacks and other connected devices. Our network superiority and long-standing relationship with enterprises,
first responders and other workers in the front lines has given us the ability to support their connectivity needs across the country when they need
Verizon most. In addition to the increase in gross adds activity, we have seen an improvement in retention for our enterprise and public sector
customers with phone churn improving by 35 basis points during this period.

We are working with all of our customers during this time to ensure they stay connected, even if they're experiencing financial hardship as a result
of COVID. We believe that our enterprise, public sector and wholesale customers will be relatively less impacted than our SMB customers initially,
but we may see increased long-term risk from the crisis. Wireless service revenues in our Business Group are being impacted by reductions in
overage fees, a reduction in international roaming and an increase in suspension of lines. Across Consumer and Business, we believe total wireless
service revenue growth could be 3 to 5 percentage points lower than originally expected in the second quarter as a result of the reduction in fees
and usage-based revenues. Additionally, bad debt expense increased as a result of our changing expectations around customer payments during
this time. In the first quarter, we increased our bad debt reserve by $228 million based on the expected number of customers who will avail
themselves of payment relief under the Keep Americans Connected Pledge. We will continue to monitor Consumer and Business payment behavior,
and we'll work with our customers to help them stay connected despite difficult circumstances. As a result, it is possible that additional bad debt
reserves may be required in the second quarter.

In Verizon Media, we are experiencing a decline in advertising and search revenue as advertisers pause, hold back or cancel campaigns during this
time and users are searching for fewer commercial terms, providing us with less opportunity for monetization. As a result, advertising revenues
declined by nearly 10% in the month of March, with COVID mostly impact in the second half of the month, and that rate of decline has increased
in April. A number of industry forecasts expect a 20% to 30% decline in digital media revenues in 2Q, and Verizon Media's results are likely to be
similar to those experienced in the broader industry.

Now let's go to Slide 18 to discuss our guidance and outlook for 2020. Obviously, the environment we find ourselves in today is vastly different
than when we originally gave guidance just a few months ago. Given the unprecedented magnitude of the conditions we have all experienced,
we are updating our financial guidance for the full year. We remain confident in our strategy, our business model and our ability to generate
sustainable long-term earnings growth. Our consolidated revenue guidance of low to mid-single-digit percent growth that we announced in
January included the expectation that 2020 equipment revenues would not create similar year-over-year headwinds as it has in the past few years.
However, device activations have been low since mid-March, and we expect that to continue throughout the second quarter, with uncertainty
around customer behavior for the remainder of the year. The wide range of potential outcomes around equipment revenue led us to determine
that it is prudent to withdraw our consolidated revenue guidance at this time. For adjusted EPS, we are revising our original guidance of 2% to 4%
growth and are now guiding to a range of negative 2% to positive 2% change from the prior year. Our new estimated range is based on a scenario
that assumes significant headwinds prevail throughout the second quarter. We have limited visibility into the second half of the year, which will
depend on various potential operating environments. We will continue to assess the impact of COVID on our business, including our bad debt
reserve, and expect to provide an update on our next earnings call based on how things develop between now and then.

Other income statement items for which we provided guidance, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted
effective tax rate, remain intact as originally guided. As we mentioned earlier, we have maintained our CapEx guidance for the full year that we
announced in March. Our supply chain remains strong, and we have not seen a material slowdown in the sourcing of necessary equipment from
our network and device partners.

We are optimistic that the measures government agencies have taken will provide support to citizens, businesses and the frontline responders
that have been impacted by this crisis. We remain keenly focused on doing our part to provide best-in-class network performance and customer
experience to all of our customers, which will continue to drive long-term operational and financial success, while weathering short term disruptions.
Despite the extreme nature of what the world is experiencing, we believe that Verizon is well suited to remain resilient through this situation.

Let's take a look at Slide 19 to discuss our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Over the past few years, we have strengthened our balance
sheet, and the results of those actions have put us in a good position to manage through the impacts of the COVID pandemic. We ended the first

quarter with $7 billion of cash on hand. Carrying a higher cash balance during a market crisis is part of our liquidity planning strategy, and we
executed on that strategy with a $3.5 billion bond offering completed in March. In addition, we started and ended the first quarter with no commercial
paper outstanding but have accessed this market in the second quarter to further enhance our liquidity. During the first quarter and before the
market disruption, we also completed one of our largest device payment securitizations of $1.6 billion.

Having a cash cushion is prudent right now for many reasons, including our expectation that certain customers may have difficulty making timely
payments as a result of the crisis. We are closely monitoring these trends with regard to their impact on our ABS programs.

In the second quarter, we had some nonrecurring cash outflows including $2.7 billion of maturities and $1.3 billion of spectrum licenses from
Auction 103. Scheduled unsecured bond maturities for the rest of 2020 are 0 as a result of our continued liability management strategy that keep
near-term maturities low. Additionally, at the end of 2019, given our funded status and prior discretionary contributions, we expect no mandatory
contributions to our pension plan until 2026, subject to market conditions. Our pension funded status has been further protected in recent years
as we have increased the hedge ratio of our liability to about 50%. This resulted in the funded status of our pension plans only declining from 92%
at year-end to 87% at the end of first quarter. Our standby credit facility with our bank group of $9.5 billion provides further assurance of our
liquidity.

Our balance sheet is strong, and our liquidity position has been further strengthened as we navigate this difficult period for our customers and the
markets. We have demonstrated the ability to access the bond and commercial paper markets in recent weeks. Our strong financial position gives
us confidence to continue to invest, while also supporting all of our stakeholders.

I'll turn it back over to Hans to provide a look at our 2020 priorities, and then we'll get to your questions.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. Let me just round this off with our priorities going into this year and in the future.

First of all, I feel that we're very well positioned to execute both in the near term and the long term to create more value for all our stakeholders.
We have the Verizon 2.0 transformation, which is a new leadership, a new network technology, a new go-to-market, and we are delivering on that.
And I feel that we have good results already right now, but more to come. I think we also have a very good strategy around the COVID-19 response
that is covering all our stakeholders in a balanced way in order to create long-term value for all of them.

The 5G is still very much in the middle, the center of our strategy. And as you heard me saying before, we're in the middle of the execution, and
we're not halting that. We're keeping it up all the time, and the team is doing great work there. And we see opportunity with 5G going forward,
both with building all the cities, the 5G mobile edge compute as well as making this nationwide 5G still this year.

Matt talked about our discipline and the financials and our capital position and our capital allocation, I feel good about that. We have done
tremendous, not in the last 12 months, but also the last 3 months, in order to put us in a good situation to continue to meet all the demands in our
capital allocation, all the way from our business, to our shareholders, to our debt holders.

And ultimately, I think the strong brand that we have has been reinforced in times like that, both by the talent we have, but also by the response
to our business practices and the way we're dealing with our society.

So all in all, I feel good about our strategy. I think that we are in the middle of execution of it. We need to have a multipronged strategy where we're
managing the crisis at the same time, but that doesn't mean we should not execute on our strategy.

So by that, I hand it back to you, Brady.

APRIL 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

A question about your updated EPS guidance. As you noted during your presentation, certain activity in the business has declined significantly. I
would assume that there's a degree of cost savings associated with that. You also highlighted some areas where you're seeing some pressures.
You highlighted roaming revenues as an example. So I was hoping you can maybe just give us a little more insight into the puts and takes that
caused you to see a slightly lower outlook for earnings over the course of the year.

And then just point of clarification, you said that this revised outlook reflects headwinds you expect to see in the second quarter. I'm curious whether
you're saying that the variance in earnings that you expect to report this year will primarily be contained to the second quarter. Or if you're saying
that those headwinds for the remainder of the year collectively result in a change?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Brett, thanks for the question, and good morning, everyone. So as you look at the guidance, and we went through some of it in the prepared
remarks. But as you look at the items that are in there, when I think about the revenue side for the second quarter, really break it up into 2 major
buckets. You think about the actions that we've taken and the actions -- or the impacts of changes in customer behavior.

So as I start to off and think about the actions we've taken, it starts with, obviously, the Keep Americans Connected Pledge for that 60-day period.
The vast majority of that is in the second quarter, and so we'll see more impact in Q2 than we saw in Q1. Additionally, as we mentioned, we've
given customers an extra 15 gigabits of data. And whether that be on metered plans or on hotspots for those customers who are on unlimited
plans. So that's going to have a significant impact on the overage fees that we would normally collect. Earlier this week, we announced that we
would be extending that 15 gigabit from the end of April through the end of May.

On the customer behavior side, one of the obvious ones is obviously international roaming. I think it's fair to say you can put a pretty low number
in your model for international roaming revenue for the second quarter. But also, in there, as we think around especially in the SMB side of the
business, we would expect to see those customers suspending some of the lines on their accounts over this time period, and that will have an
impact on revenue, too.

So when we add all those things up, we see that those should impact the year-over-year service revenue growth in kind of the 3% to 5% range in
Q2. Some of those things will obviously extend beyond Q2. Some of the things may not extend beyond Q2. Obviously, we control how much we
extend the actions. The customer behavior will obviously be impacted by more of the macro environment, so we'll see how that plays out into the
second half of the year.

So you have that there on the service revenue side. As you think about other parts of revenue, obviously, equipment revenue will be down. But 
also within media, as I mentioned, we're seeing a significant reduction. We were down 4% for the first quarter, but 10% in March. So basically, all 
of the year-over-year decline in the first quarter was contained in the COVID period. And then as we've gone into the sharp-turned second quarter 
here, we're seeing those reductions increase. So a lot of the industry forecast is 20% to 30% reduction on $1.7 billion of quarterly revenue. That's 
obviously a material number, too.

APRIL 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

So we have some benefits come through on the expense side, but obviously, those revenue impacts are going to impact the overall profitability
in the quarter. And you see that reflected in our guide.

In terms of the back half of the year, really too soon to tell. I mean there's a lot of things that play out here over the course of the next 90 days. We'll
have a much better sense of what the back half of the year looks like. And then obviously, we'll update our view on that when we get to the next
call. But we're optimistic.

What we -- that's what we don't know. What we do know is we come into this situation in a position of strength. We've had good performance in
the business over a number of quarters now. We come in with products and services that are obviously very important to customers. And we come
in with a balance sheet that we've worked on significantly over the past few years. It gives us a little bit of a shock absorber, if you will, so that we
can keep operating our business and position ourselves to come out on the other end of this situation for a position of strength. So that's how
we're kind of seeing the second quarter and as we look forward to the rest of the year ago here, Brett.

Operator

The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Great. Maybe just as a follow-up to Brett's question on that 300 to 500 basis points. Matt, can you give us any more color in terms of maybe the
sub-impact and the ARPU impact that you expect to see from all these different pieces? I mean you gave some great detail on what's going on in
April here. Maybe just a little bit sort of a total gross add impact that you expect to see? And then maybe on the ARPU side, how big these components
are that are being affected? And how that could potentially play out in that sort of 1% to 3% service revenue decline you're expecting?

And then maybe a new topic on the Fios side. When did you guys start the new policy of not entering consumers' homes? And I saw -- I think you
-- it shows here that Internet net adds are definitely slowing, but do you expect that to go negative? And then what do you see for video trends as
we look out into the second quarter?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, John. So following up on the service revenue. When you think about the ARPU, you've got the base billing, and then you've got the
additional things that go in there, whether that be international roaming, whether it be overages, whether it be late fees or whatnot. So we feel
really good about the core billings within the business. We're seeing customers use our products and services, obviously, on a -- in a very strong
fashion and I should expect to see that continue. But where we will see some pressure is around the edges with those other parts of what we bill,
whether as I say, it be roaming, overages or whatnot. So the vast majority of that 3% to 5% comes from those items that we bill that are in the
service revenue line. And then on top of that, you'll have the impact of suspends on the SMB side. We'll see how much that plays in.

So overall, most of the -- we will see an impact in ARPU there as we go through the quarter. But subs are looking in a great position, as we mentioned,
the churn is at a low level. You're looking at about a 0.5 type of range right now in Consumer. Obviously, that's very low compared to where it has
been. And I think it reflects the fact as you go into a time like this, consumers obviously value the quality of their network connection with all the
increased activity we've seen across it. So all in all, that's where you'll see the majority of the impacts in service revenue as we go into the second
quarter here.

And I'll turn it over to Hans and provide some comments around what we're doing with Fios and the engineers going into consumers' homes and
whatnot.

APRIL 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. And John, let me say one thing that we have been balancing all the time is, of course, safe and -- safety and health for our employees.
And that's why we were very early on to actually close down almost 70% of our stores and go to new sort of visiting hours and all of that.

The same we have done with our engineers in the field, very important for us to see that they are safe and healthy. And in the beginning here, we
were very restricted on visited on homes. But we've also seen a lot of innovation. And the last couple of weeks here, we have actually innovated,
so we can start installing Fios without going into the homes with both what we call the Fios in the box, which is where the consumer or the customer
is installing themselves; as well as we also have a virtual agent right now where the customer can be guided how to do the installation. That
innovation, we have been able to do in 2, 3 weeks, and now we start ramping that up. And I'm confident that over time, we almost can be back on
a normal levels of installation, but with the safe and healthy of our employees and as well for our customers.

And I think that, again, just coming back to the importance on balancing, in a crisis like this, you need to balance all the different stakeholders and
see that you really have the priorities right. And our priority has been from the beginning, the safety and health for our employees. That's very
important.

Second is, of course, to see that our networks are staying up because of the importance of our infrastructure in these times. Because we know that
the country is needing our network and our technology staying up and having the highest quality as Verizon always has. So we are managing that
every day here, and I think we're managing it very well. And as said, the innovation is now telling us and we can go back to something that is normal,
but in a totally new way of doing it. So I'm grateful for my team.

Operator

The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

To clarify one more time on this 3% to 5% in 2Q. Can you please confirm that is versus your prior expectation for year-over-year growth rather than
just year-over-year? And also, can you quantify what the service revenue headwind was in the first quarter versus the regular business growth rate?

And then second, Verizon Media revenue sounds like down 20% to 30% in the second quarter. What do the margins look like in this business? We
don't really know much about what the sort of cost flexibility is there and whether margins can stay positive or flip to negative when revenue
comes down quickly.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Phil. So as you look at the service revenue, and you think about the impacts in there, the 3% to 5% is really is going to be 3% to 5%
lower than they otherwise would have been. A reduction in the growth rates on a year-over-year basis is what you'll see there.

There was a small impact on service revenue in the first quarter. If you think across both Consumer in the 30 to 40 basis points of service revenue
growth so the 1.9% would have had some upside without the impact that we saw at the back end of March. But we're in -- we like where the position
of the service revenue trajectory is. As you come into the quarter, as you go into 2Q here, the core underlying performance of the wireless business
in both consumer and business is very strong. And we expect to see that show up in our service revenues throughout the rest of the year.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Something about the Verizon Media Group. As Matt reported, of course, that we have seen an impact lately on our advertising. We're, of course,
encouraged about the increased activity and the growth of engagement because that's ultimately going to pay off later on. And I think that, first

APRIL 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

of all, our Verizon Media team has been extremely innovative with new products and new ways of delivering services the last couple of weeks here
in a time of this pandemic.

I have to say that I have a lot of confidence in my Verizon Media Group to work with different scenarios, given how this pandemic will develop and
how it will hit Verizon Media Group. We have seen the last 18 months or, I don't know, 6 quarters that our Verizon Media Group has found ways to
both reduce direct cost and find new ways to innovate. But all in all, we need to understand that, of course, advertising these days, you are restrictive,
you're cautious given the pandemic.

But again, I think that, as I said in the beginning, we are working with different scenarios that can happen, and we have different levers and activities
that we can do given where this is going. That goes for all our different businesses, which, of course, they are in different form and shape at the
moment, but it also goes for the whole corporation.

And then just adding on what Matt said about our wireless business. I think that one thing that worked in the brand, since we embarked on the
unlimited some 2 years ago, we have constantly built a model which can actually meet all the different scenarios, all the way from our Mix & Match,
our -- in Visible, Yahoo Mobile, the work we're doing with track phone, the network as a service. I think that regardless where it will go, we will have
opportunities to actually serve our customers with the plans that they need. And I think that few others can do that in this market as well as we
have the best network. So I think we're well positioned in the world that might be uncertain, but we have all those different type of opportunities
to serve our customers.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

And just real quick on the cost side there that comes, obviously, the service revenue impact and the media revenue impact. But obviously, we're
doing things to manage the cost side of the business as we go through this period. And it's really building on the work we've been doing for the
last few years now, and it's put us in a position where we can take the actions that we need to in this time. We'll see some cost benefits as we go
through this. But it also allows us to do the things to support our employees and customers and to keep investing in the business for the long haul
even as we're in this unusual time period. So cost controls are very much on our mindset as we go through this time period as well.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

If I can just clarify as well on Brett's question. You said that a lot of the impact, I think, for the EPS cuts is in the second quarter. But I think it would
make sense that you're guiding for probably weaker earnings through the year. Is that fair?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Most of the impact in the guide is the impact that we discussed in the second quarter. As we look to the second half of the year, obviously, there's
a very wide range of potential outcomes there. So we'll see how that plays out. And obviously, when we're on this -- the next earning call, 90 days
from now, we'll have a lot more to say about the second half of the year. But a lot of the commentary we had and a lot of the updates in the guide
relates to what we'll see in 2Q. But we will see some of those revenue impacts, you think about international roaming, for example, will stay with
us for a longer time period. But we'll wait and talk more about the second half of the year when we have better visibility into it.

APRIL 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

I guess, 2, if I could, first, just kind of looking at the Slide 17, where you give us kind of the COVID environment effect on the mobile business. Could
you give us some of that similar color, Consumer, SMB and enterprise on the wireline side?

And then second, obviously, last quarter, there was a big investment in the business services group in terms of trying to modernize the tech and
the go-to-market capabilities. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on what's been accomplished thus far in that exercise? And kind of what, in
the current environment, your expectations might be for the return on that investment at this stage?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Dave. That's -- let's unpack those. Starting off with the wireline impact on the current environment. In Fios, we talked a little bit about
that. We saw good volumes in Internet in the first quarter, but that was largely a reflection of low churn as we came into this. And obviously, a lot
of appreciation from our customer base on the quality of the Fios Internet product.

As you go into the second quarter, you're going to continue to see the benefit on the churn side, but obviously we'll have some impact on the
gross adds side from the employee actions that Hans mentioned, where we're not allowing employees to really enter customers' homes.

What's really good -- what you see from us is, say, okay, how do we react to this? So Hans talked about the Fios in a box, right. Let's not let this
environment completely stop what we're doing. How do we -- yes, there's an obstacle in our way. Let's find a way around it. This team is phenomenal
on doing that. So we will have some gross adds here in the quarter that we might not have expected when we first stopped going into customers'
homes.

As you look across the other parts of wireline, as you get into SMB and the larger businesses, obviously, as we've seen an uptick in usage across the
core networks and we've been doing a number of things to help, especially our larger enterprise customers adapt very quickly to having their -- a
large number of their employees work from home and having to update their systems to be able to handle that change in network traffic and
where the work is performed. So I would expect to see a continuation of that. But it won't massively change the ongoing wireline trends -- revenue
trends that we've seen across the business as we think about second quarter here.

In terms of the investment in VBG and what you see in the margins in the first quarter there, I think we came in with a decent margin for that group.
But as I shared on the call back in January, this isn't a one quarter investment in the business. There's a number of things that we need to do to
upgrade the capabilities of our Business group so that we can be that partner of choice for businesses as we enter the fourth industrial revolution.
And so there's a lot of good activity going on there. And I'll stick with what I said on the last call that we'll be investing in that for quite a while here.
We should start to see the impact -- the benefits on the cost side towards the end of this year. And then the impacts on the revenue side in '21 and
really getting full steam in '22, so a lot to come there.

And Hans, I'll let you follow-up on that.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes, you're absolutely right, Matt. This is -- we are clear on the strategy of the Verizon Business Group. I just want to remind all of you, we brought
together several different groups on wireline and wireless and this go-to-markets. Tami and the team has very clear strategy of doing the
transformation. That has not slowed down. We continue with that because when coming into this COVID-19, we see even a more importance of
Verizon Business Group than really Matt talked about. This is one of the areas we see that we have a great opportunity going forward as we build
a Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, as we come with 5G and the trends in the industry. I mean, digitalization, all of that, which, of course, has been
accentuated in this COVID-19.

So I feel good about what we're doing here. The team is running as fast as they can with this transformation. But as Matt said, this is not the 1
quarter thing, but we're not holding back on the transformation. And in that transformation, we said we will invest, and one investment was, of

course, the BlueJeans, which we have had in our portfolio for a couple of quarters as a distributor. But as this turned out, we felt that it was a good
opportunity to actually make the acquisition, and we have been testing them. It's a great product. And we stitch that into our go-to-market in the
Verizon Business Group. But I also see it as a great opportunity for the 5G. Because ultimately, 5G at the edge, we will have a lot of low latency,
enormous throughput where video and transcoding will be important. So adding that asset is also important for the future.

So once again, we feel good about our strategy in Verizon Business Group and how they have performed. And we have some more work to be
done, and we're not holding back on that transformation as that will put us in even stronger position when they're done.

Operator

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Thanks for all the color on the COVID-19. Very helpful. I wonder, Matt, if you could get into a little more on the bad debt, help us understand where
that is across the Consumer versus Business. I'm guessing a lot of it's in SMB. How does that break wireless, wireline?

And then, Hans, could you talk a little bit about the digital channels. You talked a lot about Fios in a box. How are you thinking about maybe pushing
more of the phone sales and wireless sales through the online channel? Where are you today? And what can you do to increase that percentage?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Simon. So on the bad debt, as we look at that, the vast majority of it is sitting in the Consumer side just because of the relative difference
in the size of the businesses between Consumer and SMB. As we did the bad debt reserve this year, we're now operating under the new CECL
accounting standards. It requires us to take a more forward look at expected losses.

And so really, what we did, we took -- we looked at how many customers have availed themselves of the pledge. We used that as a starting point
for the reserve. I can tell you as of around mid-April, we have around 800,000 customers who have signed up for the pledge and some of the various
other stakeholders. The vast majority of those are in mobile, and that provided some of the bases. But it's too early to know exactly how the bad
debt requirements will play out. We'll monitor that closely here as we go forward.

But certainly, we're seeing different payment patterns across different parts of our customer base. Actually encouraged by what we're seeing on
the Consumer side here over the last couple of weeks. And another proof point that as we've talked about in the past, as we saw in the financial
crisis, that consumers continue to put their phone bill high up their list of priorities for payments.

And certainly, we're monitoring closely on the Business side, especially within SMB, how that's going to play out. Nothing in the payment patterns
at this point is overly pessimistic, but we're obviously going to stay very close to that and work to keep our relationship with our customers wherever
possible. So that hopefully gives you a little background on how we look at the bad debt. And I'll let Hans answer the question on how we see
digital channels going forward.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So let me just lay out how we're running the company right now. We're basically running the company in a 3-pronged strategy. The first prong is,
of course, the crisis management, where we have a team that is dealing with all the challenges with pandemic for our employees, for our customers
and for the society at large.

Secondly, I have the majority of my leadership team running business as usual. We have our 5G governance early this week, where we went through
all the deployment, all the 5G mobile edge compute, all the new business cases, just running as normal.

And then we have a team, which also think about the new normal. What will be the new normal when we come out from this pandemic? And one
of the question, which is, I think, I believe is going to happen, we're going to see much more digital sort of omnichannel from our customers, and
we are ready for it. We have already pivot to it. We're probably going to see another environment -- work environment that we need to think about.
We're probably going to also see a different type of product that we need to put forward.

So I try to see that we have all these 3 prongs working at the same time in order for us to come up even stronger from this crisis as well as managing
the today and not missing our target put up as well as managing the crisis at the same time. So I can only confirm, I have the same feelings as you
have. We're going to see much more of digital usage of ordering. But we're also going to see things that we never thought were possible. I mean
telehealth will increase over time. People are now and still, they don't need to go to hospital. We're going to see education -- remote education
growing because people see that it's actually working. All that's going to be new normal where we -- our assets are extremely important in that
delivery to all our customer groups. So you need to work on all 3 of them, and we are working all 3 of them to come even stronger out on this crisis.

Operator

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

I wonder if I could just ask a slightly longer-term question in the context of the COVID crisis. Your investments in wireless, which have largely been
-- in 5G, I mean, which have largely been on the back of millimeter wave spectrum, have almost necessarily been in dense, urban gathering places,
like stadiums and arenas and airports and what have you, which is obviously where people aren't today. Do you stop and say there may be a real
change in social patterns that suggest a different set of investment priorities that are more along the lines of coverage and less around dense urban
usage? Or is that likely to be sort of a short-term blip just given how long the planning windows are for network densification? I ask this in the
context of a spectrum strategy where it could well be that mid-band spectrum becomes even more important now, given a potential pivot away
from those very dense, urban gathering places.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Craig. It's still to be seen, first of all, of what will be the social patterns for the time. I feel pretty confident that dense, urban areas will
continue to be dense, urban areas. And to be honest, we still see a lot of usage in dense, urban areas. It's just that we see less movement of people
because they are staying home. So people live where they live today. So we are not changing the strategy, how we execute, both on the broader
nationwide as well on our city deployment. And ultimately, we see that as being a very compelling offering going in the future.

On the mid-band, as I said before, especially on the C-band, we think that is an attractive spectrum because, first of all, as you said, it is a good
coverage. But also, it's a global roaming standard for 5G. And of course, we want to be part of that. And we are encouraged by FCC's plan to conduct
a C-band auction in December. And we will always do our normal return on investment between the different densifications, buying spectrum,
putting more software and keeping in mind that we want to continue to have the same headrooms in the network as we always have in order to
have the best network.

So yes, it plays in. It's a little bit too early to say that we're going to have a changed total social pattern in the United States. Initially, I don't think
so. People live where they live, and that's going to continue to be the same.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

And can you comment specifically about the L-band uplink concept and the availability now of Ligado spectrum?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes, I can, or at least having some views on it. We, of course, are following what FCC has come out with. We still feel that are several challenges
with L-band. As -- first of all, it's not used. That frequency is not used anywhere in the world. That means that there are no equipment, no handsets
and things like that, which you need an ecosystem. That's so important. But as with all frequencies and all the spectrum we're, of course, looking
into it, and we have done it for several years. This is nothing new. I think that Ligado has been around for about 10 years. So it's nothing new.

So we are continuing -- our engineers are always looking into new development if something can happen. But so far, we have seen a little bit more
headwind than anything else on that band.

Operator

The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

Great. Two, if I may. First off, I was wondering if can you give us the number of customers that have stopped paying their bills, I guess, specifically
their wireless bills as a result of COVID-19? And I assume that, that number was included in your disconnect. You'd mentioned, I think, 800,000 in
response to Simon's question. Just trying to understand where that number comes into play.

And then secondly, as it relates to free cash flow and the dividend. I was wondering if you can just give us some framework in terms of how to think
about the potential dividend payout expected in 2020?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

You can start if you unmute.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Sorry about that. Thanks, Colby. So the number of customers who are referred to in the prior question was the number of customers who have
told us their ability to pay their bills has been impacted by COVID. That's not to say they've been disconnected. They haven't been disconnected.
Just like every other customer that doesn't pay completely on time that we work with them. And the vast majority of those, we end up getting
them back on a payment schedule, and they continue their relationship with us. So we haven't -- and even those who have -- prevailed themselves
of that doesn't necessarily mean that they have completely stopped paying. They are just indicating to us that they've seen an impact.

But when you look at the total impact we've seen, when I compare it to some of the numbers reported by -- whether it be on the mortgage side
or the auto loan side, we're seeing a better overall performance in terms of the customer payment profile than what we've seen. And that's consistent
with what we saw in the financial crisis in 2008 as well. I mean we have a very important product for our customers, and they value it. They value
the connection they get from the best network, and we see those show up in the payment.

So Hans, I think you wanted to make some comments around the second question on free cash flow?

APRIL 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q1 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. First of all, I think we talked about where we stand on the balance sheet and the great work the team has done with the balance sheet, not
only the last couple of years, but also in the first quarter. And we feel that we're in a very good position with our balance sheet, and that can be
seen, that we both increased our CapEx this quarter as well as made the acquisition of BlueJeans. We have our capital allocation priorities, very
clear for us: Number one is the business. Number two is the shareholders. Three is the debt reduction and number four is the buyback. And we feel
that we're in a really good situation to continue to put our Board in the right position to serve our shareholders with dividend. But as we said on
the Investor Day, when it comes to buybacks, that's probably unlikely happening this year given the situation. But all other priorities, we are definitely
in a very good position to serve at this moment.

Operator

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Just a couple of follow-ups. First, you gave a lot of detail on the potential impacts on revenue. I was curious if you could provide some additional
details to quantify or help to approximate the variability of wireless expenses to the variability of gross adds or overall device sales?

And then secondly, does the temporary use of other license holder's spectrum increase Verizon's interest to rent or lease spectrum on a commercial
basis in the future?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. So I'll answer the first question on the variability of expenses. So obviously, as we have lower volumes, you see lower handset costs
and that obviously flows through immediately. But a lot of the other expenses, as you think about it in the immediate term, don't necessarily move.
Even promo costs, for example, as we've talked about before, we now, under 606, amortize a lot of the promo expense over the expected life. So
you see that come across over 2.5 years typically versus an immediate cost. So if we get a reduction, that benefit of lower promo expenses also
gets amortized over that time period in the income statement. So you're going to see that flow through there.

Other areas where you see an impact from volumes, where we have lower volumes, especially in store, we see lower accessory sales, and those
typically have a good margin on. We -- and so there are impacts there as well from seeing lower sales, not just in terms of lower expenses, but there
is an impact on the revenue line that can come with that.

So net-net, you do see a reduction in cost with lower volumes, but there's some other things that go in the other direction and some of the benefits
in expense are going to get realized over time rather than immediately in there. So hopefully, that helps you think around how that shows up in
the income statement.

Hans, I'll let you add -- follow up on the question on the spectrum that we took advantage of.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. First of all, we want to thank the FCC for so rapidly come out and lending out spectrum to all the players in the market because nobody knew
how the usage will be on the network. As you can see, when we exclude the temporary spectrum that we lent from FCC, we have the same headroom,
and the network has performed very well. On top of that, we are, of course, adding capacity right now and also put in the DSS, the dynamic spectrum
sharing, which I can report that the tests are going very well. We're on plan for putting that opportunity in the hands of Tami and Ronan to decide
when they want to turn on nationwide. So I think we have a very good spectrum strategy and with the spectrum we have, and we're very happy
with it, and we're going to continue with that. So I think that's where we are right now.

Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

Hans, I just wanted to follow-up on your DSS comments. So if I go back to my notes from mid-February following the Analyst Day, it seemed like
you were very firm in saying DSS by year-end -- 5G by year-end with DSS. Is there any change to that?

And then just on the infrastructure behind it, you also talked about -- or Kyle talked about 5x the amount of small cells for 5G this year. Has any of
the shifts, given the changes in social patterns, shifted back the macro there?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Jennifer. First of all, we feel good about the dynamic spectrum sharing. It's -- we are continue to do the test and deploying equipment
and the hardware in the field that is needed for doing that. I'm certain that Kyle and his team will put it in the hands of Ronan and Tami and decide
when they turn it on in the second half. That's where we are today. So we're not have any supply issues to doing that or supply chain issues.

The same go for the 5x more -- 5G ready base station this year. We continue to just accelerate. And Kyle actually said publicly that we were ahead
of the plan when we ended March. I can say today, we're still on plan on that 5x. We have no supply chain issues. We have, of course, complications
with some municipalities, but our team is all around that and working with municipalities, finding new way, digital approval, things that we never
thought were -- digital permitting processes, et cetera, which we never thought were possible.

So all in all, we are not giving up on those targets. And so far, it looks really good. And that's how a company should execute in times like this,
managing the crisis, seeing that it will be a new -- and rethink how the new normal will look like. And that's what my team is doing every day right
now, and we are very focused on doing that. And the good thing is that we feel good about our strategy where it stands.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

And thanks, Hans and team. And everybody, make sure you stay safe and be well. And with that, we'll conclude the call.

PRESENTATION

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being
recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

APRIL 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.27 per share on a GAAP basis.
Reported first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from a special item of approximately $223 million related to the sale of certain wireless licenses.
Excluding the effects of this special item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the first quarter.

On April 8, we announced a recall process for approximately 2.5 million Jetpack units, which impacted some customers enrolled in our distance
learning program. The overall impact included within consolidated operating income was approximately $160 million during the quarter, split
between $100 million in the Business segment and the remaining $60 million in Consumer. The impact included within reported and adjusted
earnings per share was $0.03 in the first quarter.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Brady, and welcome to all to this first quarter earnings call.

We marked more than 1 year since the devastating effects of COVID-19. While we see significant progress in vaccination, customer sentiment and
recovery of our economy, there's still a lot to go before we're back to normal.

I'm proud of how Verizon has responded during this period for all our stakeholders as we have executed on our balanced stakeholder-driven
strategy. And as I said during the worst period of the pandemic, Verizon will come out stronger as a company when this is over.

During the last 12 months, we have progressed all our position with customers, employees and added great assets to an already strong position.
And today, we stand stronger than ever to compete in the market and serve our customers.

Looking back on the quarter, we amplified and accelerated our strategy through our average 160 megahertz nationwide position in C-Band. And
as we laid out in our Investor Day, the combination of C-Band and our millimeter wave places us in a unique position of strength to execute on all
5G opportunities: 5G Home, 5G Mobility and 5G mobile edge compute.

On top of that, we have all our 5 vectors of growth in play together with our network leadership and a strong Network-as-a-Service foundation.
And the progress we made in the quarter confirms that our strategy is working. We had growth in all our businesses for the first time since the
launch of Verizon 2.0. We had growth in both EPS and cash flow.

With all this work by our great team, we have a head start in the post-COVID era with a clear and differentiated strategy, diverse go-to-market
models, network leadership, industry-leading partner ecosystem and a strong brand, all of which together provides a great platform and foundation
to achieve our growth targets for 2021 and beyond.

Let me talk about some of the highlights from the first quarter. Our network team continues to do great things by leading the network performance
in the market as well as deploying more assets than ever before: millimeter wave, C-Band, 4G, 5G and fiber. I have a lot of confidence that this team
will accelerate our network leadership.

Our unique Mix & Match model continues to deliver with the migration to unlimited and unlimited premium in the quarter as well as building on
our exclusive offerings like Disney+ and the most recent discovery+ that was launched earlier in the quarter. And we are pleased with the discovery+
with the current enrollment rates we have seen so far.

Our brand and responsible business framework, Citizen Verizon, continue to set standards in the industry. Verizon was recognized by Fast Company
as the sixth most innovative company in the corporate social responsibility earlier this quarter. Brand Finance recognized us as the most valuable
telecom brand.

APRIL 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Within ESG, we have ambitious goals such as our commitment to be net 0 in the carbon emission by 2035. Our long-standing focus on diversity,
equity and inclusion is evidenced by the fact that we have 100% pay equity by gender globally and by race ethnicity in the United States. And
earlier this week, we also launched our 2020 ESG report.

We continue with a high level of deployment of millimeter wave and fiber in the quarter. And we're on the track to deliver on our operational
targets for the year. We brought 5G service to several additional cities. We currently have 30 5G Home and 67 5G Mobility cities live and more to
come.

We recently signed our first European private 5G deal with Associated British Ports. We also expanded our 5G Edge partnership with AWS with
private 5G and edge computing to our customers.

We continue to scale our Network-as-a-Service strategy across new markets and verticals through a diverse set of partnerships. We have partnered
with leading brands across diverse verticals such as Honda to innovate connected and autonomous driving; Deloitte and SAP to create a 5G and
edge computing retail digital platform that will provide retailers with real-time operations data; and Dreamscape and Arizona State University to
build and commercialize immersive learning and training.

At our Investor Day, we shared with you our plans and commitment for C-Band and Ultra Wideband deployment, which continues to progress
well. Our intent is to invest $10 billion of incremental C-Band CapEx to accelerate the integration on this capacity into our network. We recently
signed deals with Crown Castle and SBA to accelerate our C-Band deployment and look forward to providing further updates on the build status
throughout the year.

We have already ordered half of the total network equipment needed from our 5G suppliers to support C-Band deployments in 2021. And the
satellite operators are on track to clear the spectrum between third and fourth quarter of 2021 for the first tranche of spectrum.

In addition, we continue to expand our Ultra Wideband coverage in Q1. We deployed 3,600 new Ultra Wideband sites. And to date, we have close
to 21,000 sites on air and on track to reach 30,000 by end of this year.

One Fiber form the strategic backbone of our intelligent edge network, and we continue to expand fiber deployment. And to date, we have deployed
more than 42,000 route miles. We were also pleased with the low rates we achieved for long-term financing of this critical strategic investment.
We view the record investor demand as support of our strategy and our financial discipline.

Lastly, we were also very proud to offer prominent roles to 9 diversity and inclusion financial firms as part of the USD 25 billion financing.

As I outlined earlier, our investments in our network and customers are generating solid revenue growth across all 3 of our operating groups. Our
success in Mix & Match continue to drive uptake of unlimited plans and higher ARPA, supporting year-over-year growth of 2.4% in wireless service
revenue, up from 2.2% in the fourth quarter last year.

Ronan and the team closed out Q1 with strong momentum. And I'm excited to see their Q2 performance now that almost all of our stores have
reopened. In addition, we see solid growth in Fios and with Fios Internet reporting the best first quarter net adds in 6 years. Additionally, Verizon
Media Group continues to contribute meaningful growth, including the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year on the
top line.

With that, let me ask Matt to provide some deeper insight to the financial of the first quarter.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. As Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, the first quarter has been a truly exciting and
transformative period for our company. I am pleased to report that we're off to an excellent start for the year based on our strong operational and
financial performance.

APRIL 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

We are seeing continued strength in our core business with traction across all 5 of our growth vectors, driving higher revenues and increased
demand for our products and services. With the positive momentum exiting the first quarter and the ongoing recovery of business activity, we are
highly confident that our actions in the marketplace all deliver strong results throughout the year.

In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $32.9 billion, up year-over-year by 4.0%. High-quality sustainable wireless service revenue
growth, a recovery in wireless equipment revenues, strong Fios momentum and excellent digital advertising trends resulted in revenue growth
across Consumer, Business and Media.

Total wireless service revenues were up 2.4% year-over-year, an acceleration from the 2.2% year-over-year growth that we delivered in the fourth
quarter. Additional details on total wireless performance are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings
release schedules on our website.

Total Fios revenues were up 2.5% year-over-year driven by the strong broadband volumes in recent quarters. Our portfolio of mobility and broadband
products and services continues to lead the industry, delivering value to our customers. And we are well positioned to maintain and expand our
leadership position as we enter new markets and broaden our offerings and network capabilities.

I'm extremely proud of the team's execution of our business excellence program over the past 3 years. At the end of the first quarter, we achieved
our cumulative cash savings goal of $10 billion, well ahead of our year-end 2021 target. We will realize additional benefits moving forward from
the ways we've improved our operating systems and procedures. As we've said previously, we will create additional savings opportunities on a
continuous basis beyond this program.

The strong revenue performance across our 3 business segments for the quarter, combined with our best-in-class cost structure and disciplined
focus on the business, delivered adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion, which represents growth of 2.0% over the prior year. The Jetpack recall had a 50
basis point impact to adjusted EBITDA margin during the quarter.

Brady highlighted the adjusted EPS for the first quarter at $1.31. The growth of 4.0% reflects the strength in our core business and sets the stage
for Verizon to fully capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace while giving us excellent momentum relative to our full year adjusted EPS
guidance.

Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. This quarter, we continue to see excitement around our unlimited
offerings, 5G capabilities, Mix & Match value proposition and our best-in-class Fios broadband services. All of this is part of our customer differentiation
strategy, which drives deeper and broader relationships with our customers.

Starting with wireless. We had total postpaid activations of 6.4 million for the quarter, up approximately 14% compared to the same period last
year, made up of approximately 2.3 million gross adds and 4.1 million upgrades. First quarter seasonality drove phone net losses of 225,000, which
included the last major cohort of disconnects of approximately 90,000 phones related to our Keep America Connected program.

Early in the quarter, wireless in-store sales were again tempered by our COVID safety protocols as we saw elevated levels of store closures and
limited foot traffic. Beginning in March, the improved COVID environment allowed for almost all of our stores to be open.

Not surprisingly, we saw our best volume of the quarter in March, producing positive phone net adds in the month. The strong March momentum,
combined with our new innovative promotional offers, positions us well for the second quarter.

We continue to be pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting. Similar to last quarter, over 90% of new accounts came in on an
unlimited plan, and over 50% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 65% of our base was on an unlimited
plan with more than 23% of our base taking a premium plan.

We have plenty of room to continue to expand these penetration rates and believe that they will grow alongside our 5G adoption rates, which
currently resides at 14% of our consumer postpaid phone base. 5G adoption and the customer differentiation associated with our premium and

unlimited plans will further benefit our retention efforts, which remained strong in Q1, with phone churn of 0.77% for the quarter. We continue to
take a balanced and cost-effective approach to customer retention with strong NPS scores, best-in-class network performance and strong value
proposition, leading to our excellent levels of customer retention.

Turning to Fios. We posted our third consecutive quarter of strong growth and high take rates for our best-in-class broadband products with
consumer Fios Internet net adds of 98,000, well ahead of the first quarter 2020 performance of 59,000. Total Fios Internet net adds of 102,000 was
the best first quarter performance in 6 years. This reflects both the quality of the product as well as the positive sentiment around our Mix & Match
home pricing structure, which provides our customers with unmatched simplicity and optionality.

Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. The higher phone activations in the quarter were the major driver of the
4.7% increase in operating revenues to $22.8 billion. The continued adoption of our unlimited and premium unlimited plans drove a 1.5% increase
in Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter of $13.7 billion. This growth comes even as TravelPass and our international roaming revenues
remain at subdued levels.

Strong Internet volumes drove the 2.2% increase in Consumer Fios revenue to $2.9 billion. While we continue to experience revenue pressure
associated with secular video trends, our broadband subscriber growth, combined with the shift up in speed tiers, more than offset that pressure
and will continue to drive solid revenue performance for us.

Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.8% to $10.4 billion. The EBITDA margin was 45.5% in the quarter, down 90 basis points from the prior year due
to higher volumes, which drove increased equipment revenues and associated costs as well as the Jetpack recall, which had approximately 30
basis points of impact on EBITDA margin for the quarter.

Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Our Business team continues to lead the industry towards next-generation B2B applications.
Hans referenced some of their accomplishments from the prior 90 days, including announcements on MEC and private 5G.

In addition, we launched Verizon Frontline, our branding for our advanced network and technology we deliver for first responders. Being the
wireless market share leader for public safety and in all of our other customer groups puts us in an ideal position with our customers to be their
digital transformation partner of choice.

Business wireless trends continued their strong momentum in the first quarter of 2021. Postpaid activations were 2 million with total net adds of
156,000, including 47,000 phones. Remember that Q1 of last year benefited from the COVID-related bulk purchases, providing much of the variance
for the year-over-year change in gross and net adds.

Public sector demand remains strong even as distance learning programs settle into a more normal pattern of buying activity. Small and medium
business trends improved sequentially as the team continues to make progress in supporting local businesses as they position for an improving
environment.

As more stores reopened in early March, not only did consumer volume see a lift, SMB volumes benefited as well, an encouraging sign for the
rebound. Our enterprise team continues to assist our customers in their digital transformation and unlock the potential of 5G.

Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, an improvement of 1 basis point over the prior year. Our strong churn performance
reflects the strength and reliability of our network, combined with the full suite of services and solutions that we provide.

Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. The high demand for our services and our brand reputation for reliable
connectivity have translated into healthy revenue growth of Verizon Business Group.

Operating revenues for the Business segment was $7.8 billion, up 1.3% year-over-year, the highest rate of growth since the creation of the Business
segment in the Verizon 2.0 structure. This growth highlights the success of our business transformation process as strong wireless service growth
of 6.2% offset secular pressure in wireline.

APRIL 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, down approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. The Jetpack recall mentioned
earlier had a more pronounced impact on the Business segment, reducing EBITDA margins by about 130 basis points.

Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continues to deliver strong performance driven by high
customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up approximately
10.4% from a year ago, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising
trends growing 26%, including 45% growth in DSP revenues.

Revenue from our owned and operated brands grew 13% compared to the same period last year. We saw continued high consumer engagement
with strength in sports and finance as daily active users grew 22% and 8%, respectively, from the prior year.

Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.7 billion, up approximately $0.9
billion from the prior year driven by our continued operational discipline and net benefits from our liability management activities, which lowered
borrowing rates from last year.

Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $4.5 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach
and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. This includes approximately $40 million for C-Band-related items.

As a result, free cash flow for the quarter was $5.2 billion, up 46% year-over-year. We made payments of $45 billion in the first quarter to the FCC
for C-Band spectrum won at the recently completed Auction 107. To finance this purchase, we raised over $31 billion in March in addition to the
$12 billion raised in Q4. The weighted average maturity of these C-Band borrowings was 17 years, and we achieved a very attractive average cost
of funding of 2.5%, benefiting from record order books for our U.S. dollar offerings.

We are delighted that the credit rating agencies consider the spectrum asset purchases as strategic and critical to our business operations and
held their rating levels unchanged. The success in the capital markets is a result of our disciplined capital allocation policy, coupled with our
consistent track record of delivering on our commitments made to our investors.

We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $137.4 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9x.
Based on our current cash flow assumptions, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 2.8x by the end of the year. We will evaluate
the level of our cash balance based on the recovery in the economy and developments with the pandemic.

Now let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. As Hans mentioned in his opening remarks, we are on track to achieve our guidance for
the year, which remains unchanged.

Reaffirming our comments from the Investor Day last month, we expect no material impact to our adjusted earnings per share guidance from our
C-Band program for this year. We do expect C-Band-related capital spending to be between $2 billion to $3 billion for 2021, and we will provide
updates on the quarterly earnings calls.

With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2021.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. Let me sum this up in a couple of easy buckets. First of all, our strategy is unchanged. Our focus is clear. We're going to accelerate
our multipurpose network strategy, including the C-Band that we have acquired.

We're going to focus on amplifying, accelerated the 5 vectors of growth. And we're going to see with that, that we're going to deliver on our 2021
commitments, both operationally and financially. And as I said earlier, I feel really good about our position and the team that I have that they will
deliver on that.

With that, I hand it over to Brady.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Great. Hans, could we get your thoughts on the competitive landscape now and maybe whether the new pricing from Comcast or any other
competitive development sort of affects your view of the return to growth in terms of postpaid phone net adds here in the second quarter? From
your -- the last slide there, it looks like that you expect some nice acceleration.

And then secondly, there's potentially just a massive amount of federal stimulus money flowing into broadband infrastructure deployment over
the next year or 2. I realize we're very early in the process and the rules aren't laid out yet, but do you think Verizon is in a position to capture some
of those funds as you sort of continue your heavy spending on Ultra Wideband deployment?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, John. On the competitive situation, I mean, as you have seen yourself, it is a competitive market, and it's been for quite a while. But with
our model, I can see that we are actually winning in any case because with our growth trajectory that we have in all our businesses and the unique
bundle, especially on the Consumer side with the Mix & Match, the value proposition. And you saw in the quarter, we continue to do that.

And -- but also, as Matt mentioned, it was a little bit light in the beginning of the quarter because stores that were closed to that, et cetera. And
then we saw a very good sort of strength in our port ratios and our growth in the end of the quarter because we have all the stores open. So we
look forward to the second quarter and the second part of the year.

And as Ronan said when we had the Investor Day, we believe we're going to have a good second part of the year. Second quarter is really close to
us. And what we have seen so far, we feel good about it. So again, we have an overall strategy in order to address the market for consumer that is
really working with these step-ups, the migrations and all of that. So in general, we feel good about it.

The team is doing well. You saw we came out with a new promo as well. And we have always had -- we have a lot of financial discipline. We do this
because we know we can actually capture market at good high-quality customers.

On the infrastructure, I mean, as you said, this is in the planning stages. So it's hard to say if this is -- will go through or not. So -- but on the other
hand, I think that what we are telling the administration is, of course, that accessibility, affordability and usability are the 3 buckets to address the
digital divide.

And when it comes to accessibility, we have to recognize, and I worked in 180 countries with networks, that the networks during the COVID-19 in
the U.S., they were really working well. There were basically no major issues at all. They could deliver even though traffic moved around.

So I think that what we are advocating for, we want that private sector continue to invest in the network and leading that charge and then having
government work more with the affordability of it. So we have plans that meets all needs for all different customer segments in the market. So
that's what we're advocating for. That's the same as BRT is advocating for as well. We don't think that any price regulation would be -- that will be
contra productive to the market.

So in general, again, it's very early on. I mean it's a plan that has not been approved and submitted. But at least we're advocating, together with
BRT and with ourselves, what we think should be the right. Matt, any more comments on the competitive landscape?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

No. I think you touched on the key points, Hans. The only other thing I'd add is you mentioned the strong momentum coming out of margin to
the quarter. You add that with the promotion that we put in place at the start of the month, we think is an innovative promotion that's addressing
a customer pain point that nobody else has addressed in the past. We're seeing good traction on that in the early days of that. So we certainly feel
good about the momentum heading into the quarter on the volume side. When you add that in with the financial performance we saw in the first
quarter, we're set up nicely for 2Q and the rest of the year.

Operator

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

You had another strong quarter with Fios Internet. Perhaps you could just give us a little bit of insight into the sustainability of that? Obviously,
2020 was a great year in terms of broadband demand, but you seem to be sustaining that into this year. Is this share? Is this incremental marketing
opportunities? And what's happening with the speed-up tiering there?

And maybe related to that, on 5G Home, you've had a number of announcements here recently. I know we're headed to 15 million households.
But what's the latest on the ground today? And what should we expect through the year?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Simon. Yes, we had a good Fios quarter again. I mean, overall, I think the broadband is in demand and our high-quality Fios, of course,
a great opportunity for us to expand on them.

We -- I think, personally, that this will continue. The demand for broadband will continue. We are just starting a total revolution of using technology,
which is scalable and sustainable in the post era of the COVID. So -- and we are a great position. And that also is going to help me tremendously
when we come with 5G Home, on millimeter wave and C-Band and all that because we know how to deal with home broadband. And that is an
advantage we have to any others that is trying to do fixed wireless access, and we have been on to it for a long time.

And as you saw as well, I mean, now we're up to over 30 markets with 5G Home, I mean added some 20 very recently. So we are on fire on this right
now. We have very big belief in our 5G Home. And then later in the year, when C-Band comes, we're going to add even more coverage on that.

And all is embedded in how we work with the ecosystem from the beginning and how we have developed our own IPRs on how to do self-install,
how to do all the sort of grids when it comes to millimeter wave and having a great opportunity to see that our customer gets a fantastic service.
So all in all, this is a full package that we are bringing to the market in order to have a fully scaled broadband for the country. And I think it's absolutely
the right moment.

But don't forget on the business side as well, we now -- it's called 5G Internet on the business side. We are using the same methodology. We are
doing the scaling on the same platforms, and we address another market with it. It goes back to a strategy that we had for all the time. We have a
Network-as-a-Service, and we scale it with different customers. And that scale will help us with growth, but it also means that with the platform
thinking we have, that will fall to the bottom line. And if you see in this quarter, all 3 units are growing. And we're bringing it to all to bottom line,
and we still have more to do. But we know how to do it, and we have the model.

Operator

The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

So earlier this week, you announced that you had officially commenced the deployment of your C-Band licenses and that you would expect 100
million POPs to be covered by at least 60 megahertz as we get into March of next year. Equally important to creating that coverage is making sure
your customer base is able to use that capacity, which is going to require a fairly significant handset upgrade cycle.

You noted that you had just put a new promo into the market this quarter. How are you thinking about stimulating device upgrades over the
course of the year? What's embedded in your guidance in terms of maybe doing more of this?

And then just as a follow-up question, you had noted you do expect that the Phase 1 spectrum will be cleared by 3Q, 4Q. But it seems like you don't
expect to be fully utilizing it until March. So there's a bit of a gap. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can do to close that or that's just what
the supply chain can deliver right now.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. When it comes to -- first of all, I can only say that we are on to a fast start on the C-Band. I mean, it's only some 6 weeks ago since we can start
to talk to our employees, we could talk to our partners, we can talk to the satellite companies, our suppliers. And as you have seen, I mean, we have
already ordered half of the equipment. We have made agreements with the tower cos. We have talked to the satellite companies that has reaffirmed
that they believe that they can clear this first tranche of the spectrum in third quarter and fourth quarter.

So we're -- and we actually made a press release yesterday that we're now starting deploying C-Band as well, and that's 6 weeks. So we are -- the
technology team was on fire to make this happen. And as I said, when we had this see -- at our Investor Day, we said that we worked with the dates
we've got from the FCC because we haven't talked to anybody. Right now, this is the best date we have. And of course, we are pushing as much
as possible to see that we get this up for our customers as soon as possible in order to get a great experience.

And then flowing that over to the phone question, I think that we have seen a great uptake on 5G phones and on unlimited premium. And as Matt
said, in the quarter, over 20% of the unlimited new customers took unlimited premium. That tells you there's a lot of value in it and a lot of 5G unit.

And with the new promo that Matt talked about, we believe that is going to also drive 5G. So we believe that what we have in the market right
now will continue to grow the 5G base. And as I said, this is growing faster than what we saw in 4G. So we will continue to monitor, of course, but
we see a good uptake on it. And we can also add that when it comes to the iPad that have been just recently launched, it's also another additional
millimeter wave and how that comes into the whole ecosystem.

So again, we feel good about the uptake, and we feel good about the line of products we have. And we have the promo supporting it. So that's
going to also go well together with the C-Band deployment coming later this year then.

Operator

The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

I wonder if you can dig into the enterprise and small and medium business results. SMB was up year-to-year, which is great to see. And I'm curious
what you see in bookings versus growing revenue this quarter.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Phil, thank you. Yes, we -- one of the hardest-hit businesses during the COVID-19 has been small and medium businesses. And for the simple reason
that they are most vulnerable of these type of things and the economic recession.

And we had enormously strong wireless business with SMBs coming into the COVID-19 that actually came down quite a lot. We have seen over
the year that we slowly are coming back on that. And in this quarter, we actually had a very small growth in SMB.

So as the economy recover, we think our positioning is really good on the wireless side, but also with the 5G Internet, meaning fixed wireless access,
I think we have a great combination to support our customers with that on top of some value-added services on top of it. And I know that Tami
and the team is working with this every day.

I don't think we're over it that SMBs are coming back immediately. But clearly, we see some signs of improvement in the base.

On the enterprise side, on the large enterprise side, I think we have the tale of 2 cities here again. I mean, you have certain large enterprises that
are really impacted by the COVID-19 and the recession. They are basically holding back on investments.

Then you have certain that has been fortunate in these tough times to actually grow better and having a lot of demand. So they are investing. And
that is giving the blended rate that we have right now. And of course, in the enterprise business, we have the wireline sort of secular decline in the
wireline, which will not go away, but the wireless business is coming in. Our mobile edge compute is happening. You saw how many announcement
we did in the first quarter. We start to see exactly what we have predicted, that this year is the year of building the funnel and making this customer
commercial. And Tami and the team are working together with Kyle, our CTO, every day to see that the customers are really seeing the benefit of
it.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Is there any impact here from the One Fiber initiative? Is that helping at all in the enterprise or SMB side? Or is it still too early for that?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I think on the enterprise side, of course, we have some opportunities with the fiber. But remember, our priorities was clear. It's getting fiber to our
4G and our 5G network. That's really where we get the most bang for the buck. And then we do transfer enterprise when we have them.

On the small and medium, that's going to take some time, that's what I said before. But now when we have the 5G Internet where we actually have
fixed wireless access, we have a really good product for small and medium businesses. So some possibilities in enterprise, but they are also still to
come. As we said, it's more focused on building the network with fiber, right, so we can see that our customer get the experience that they need
to have when it comes to our exceptionally great 5G with millimeter wave and C-Band.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

But Phil, just a follow-on on that. I mean, it is part of, as Hans mentioned previously, about building the network once and then monetizing it
different ways. Just as we talk about with wireless and 5G, monetizing it in different ways. With the fiber, we have the same opportunity, too.

So once you -- as you're lighting up those cell sites when you go past an enterprise building, the opportunity to go in there and have more customers
or enterprise customers on-net rather than paying third-party access absolutely is an opportunity for us to create incremental return on that
investment in fiber. So again, another example of a multiuse network.

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

I guess the first one, on the Fios revenue. We saw a pretty strong pickup. I know that kind of on a year-over-year basis, there's been a mix shift in
an uptake on the higher speed broadband services, but sequentially, it was just a big number. I was wondering if you guys did something on price
on the broadband or even on the video that would have contributed to that move.

And then the second question, I guess, Matt, you guys threw a lot of numbers out on Media. 26% advertising growth, 13% owned property growth,
10.4% total revenue growth. Could you kind of break that down, what the moving parts are kind of dragging down some of those bigger, higher,
eye-popping numbers? And kind of is this kind of a 1-year level set over a depressed 2020 and we're going to return to some kind of more "normal"
revenue growth pattern in 2022?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, David. So if I start with the Fios revenue, what you're really seeing here is the impact of what the team started. In the first quarter last
year, we introduced Mix & Match into our Fios offering. It's been great for our Consumer business. We introduced it into Fios in first quarter last
year.

Obviously, the initial benefit we were seeing there got interrupted as the pandemic got underway. But you saw, we now have 3 quarters of very
strong volumes starting in third quarter last year, fourth quarter and now again in the first quarter here, our best first quarter in total Fios for 6
years. And so what that means is you've got an Internet base of customers in Fios that's now more than 5% or higher than it was a year ago. And
so that's driving the revenue growth even if you have the secular pressures coming on the video side.

It's really volume created as much as step-ups or anything else, although there are obviously step-ups in there and opportunities to move customers
to gigabit service and so on. But the strong volumes based off the quality of service, combined with bringing the Mix & Match there, it's worked
very well for us in consumer mobility, now working well for us in Fios. And as you saw, we brought the Mix & Match construct into our SMB wireless
offerings as well. So very excited about what that's going to do.

On the Media revenue side, as you say, the 10.4% up double digits for the second consecutive quarter. You remember both fourth quarter and
now first quarter aren't really lapping COVID-impacted quarters. So what you're seeing here is the benefit of the hard work the team has been
doing over the past couple of years. And that's really showing up on the advertising trends as we talked about there, offsetting that, to your question,
how do you get from those higher numbers down to the 10%? Things like search revenue continue to be a headwind and will likely continue to
be so. But we're very encouraged by the advertising and the O&O momentum that we have. And as you say, now we -- that's not a 1-year thing.
As we go forward, the team is getting some good momentum. Hans?

APRIL 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. David, yes, I just want to reiterate on the Verizon Media Group, again, we got back to where we started the strategy in 2018. We reset
the business plan and we start to cut costs, then we reshaped all the products all the way from the open, owned and operated, all the old brands,
we combined the ad platform. The work has been immense by the Verizon Media Group team. And now we see sort of the fruits of that hard work
with the growth in 2 consecutive quarters with double digits.

So I just want to shout out to the team that this was the plan we set, and they are actually delivering on the plan. So I think we have a great future
with these guys. They have clearly a good product portfolio, and we know digital is going to be important in the future. So by that, I think we're in
a good position.

Operator

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

I was curious if we could go back to one of the comments you made earlier about Verizon reaching the cumulative cost-cutting target of $10 billion.
And if you could unpack that in terms of how much of that helped the EBITDA versus the CapEx side of the investment process for Verizon? And
then maybe secondly, how should investors think about the pace going forward of what incremental cost cutting can look like for Verizon over
the next 3 to 5 years?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. And so look, I am incredibly proud of the team's efforts over the past 3-plus years now as we've really leant in on identifying ways to
continue to make us more efficient and maintain our position and having the best cost structure in the industry, which we think is going to continue
to be important going forward, obviously.

In terms of your first question, it's -- there's a split between both CapEx and P&L items behind the $10 billion. It's roughly even between those 2
where you see that come from.

So on the CapEx side, that means we've been able to do more deployments for the same amount of money than we would have done previously.
That's allowed us to do some of the things across the network as we continue to transform the network, not just in deploying 5G but also the
intelligent edge network transformation going on, the One Fiber, there's a backbone in there as well, that's going to give us benefits for years to
come as a result of some of the efficiencies.

And then on the P&L side, some of those have helped contribute to the bottom line. But some of them have also allowed us to reinvest in the
business so that we can continue to be competitive in the marketplace, continue to bring new promotions and so on to our consumers. And you
see the value of us doing that.

And in terms of the pace going forward, just because we've hit the target, it doesn't mean we slow down. We will have continuous improvement
going forward here. The team's got good momentum. And the great news is we didn't coast to the finish line here. We ran through the finish line.
We accelerated through the tape. There's a lot more opportunities for us. Obviously, the last year has identified even more items for us. So as we
go forward, we will continue to increase the efficiency of the business, both on the income statement and also from a capital side as well. So a lot
more to come.

APRIL 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Now, and I just want to agree with Matt. I mean I think the structural changes on platform thinking and using -- making the network with the Verizon
Intelligent Network. Some of those benefits, we haven't even seen yet even with those investments are done. But also the new structure we have
in the group where we have the 3 strong CEOs running their businesses has also unveiled much more efficiencies than we have seen before and
how they run it.

So I agree with Matt, I mean this is part of our governance constantly to see that we find more efficiency because that means that we can be even
stronger in the market and having the best cost structure for us is important.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

And is this a target you would expect to continue to give further updates on and compare it relative to what the initial $10 billion goal was? Or
now that you've achieved the goal, does the progress just get wrapped into the totality of financial performance and outlooks for Verizon?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. As we go forward here, I mean, obviously, over the past 3, 4 years, as we looked at the opportunities ahead of us, this was a major opportunity.
So that's why we gave a very specific target.

As I mentioned, we'll continue to work with this. It will be obviously inherent in our targets. But as I think about the biggest opportunities ahead
of us over the next 3 to 4 years, they're around growth, everything we're doing with 5G and all the other parts of our business. So that's why the
targets that we gave at the Investor Day were all about growth, whether that be how quickly we're going to deploy the C-Band that we got,
continuing to build that millimeter wave, the total addressable markets for 5G Home, for MEC and then the revenue growth that we talked about
over the next 5 years.

So that's -- we will obviously continue to drive cost savings and efficiencies throughout the business. But the biggest opportunities for us going
forward here when we look at everything in front of us is driving top line growth, and we're very excited about pursuing those.

The next question is from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst

So Comcast significantly changed its pricing on your -- in the MVNO to now offer sort of family line -- family plan discounts. Can you just talk about
the renegotiation that you and the cable industry just had on the MVNO and what your view is of the kind of the status of that relationship and
how you see it evolving going forward? Obviously, the new pricing is considerably more aggressive and now sits on top of your pricing all the way
down in family plans up to about 4 or 5 lines.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Craig, I cannot go into detail to any commercial agreements we have. But what I can say is that we feel good about our Network-as-a-Service
strategy where we have our value -- our own sort of premium brand with Verizon. We have the MVNOs addressing a certain part. And then we have
the Visible and all of that. That's the whole idea. And for us, this is accretive.

We have a good relationship with our MVNO partners. We see them as enterprise customers, but we also see that this is accretive to us because
we have all this. I mean, nobody in the market has the same opportunity as we have to play all the way from our premium Verizon, which you heard
Matt and me talk about how we migrate and we're doing it in a great job, Ronan and team. And then we also have the MVNO partners bringing in
customers and revenue and the best return on investment.

And ultimately, we start building new markets with Visible and later on this year, with TracFone. And then we have an unparalleled position to
anyone else in the market to be growing. So I feel good about it. I feel good about the relationship with MVNOs. We treat them as important
enterprise customers, and we will continue to do so.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would agree with everything that Hans said. Look, the idea of bundled pricing for customers, I think we -- when we introduced Share Everything
Plans back in 2012, we -- so it's something we've been doing for a long time. It makes a lot of sense. And we -- as Hans said, we're glad to have the
traffic on our network. And it just gives us another opportunity to monetize the network in multiple different ways.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst

And if I could just ask one follow-up. Do you have any update on the timing of the TracFone transaction and the progress through regulatory in
Washington?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I think what -- everything we said from the beginning is holding true. The process is continuing as expected. And as I said, this is a second half of
'21 event when this is going to be approved. So it's progressing as expected. We don't believe it's going to be earlier. We think it's going to be
somewhere in the third quarter, which we said also when we announced this.

So we will give an update when we know more, but there's a couple of different events still there. So -- but again, it's progressing as we expected
from the beginning.

The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

Two questions. One, AT&T obviously has phone subsidies for all. Do you think this becomes a permanent fixture in the industry again?

And then secondly, business, I think, communications networking probably transformed more in the last year than the last decade with a lot more
collaboration and conferencing. And obviously, you acquired BlueJeans a year ago. Can you talk about how well integrated that is for the rest of
your communication strategy and go-to-market strategy? And maybe are you creating more UCaaS products or other bundles of SD-WAN services
to go after the business market?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. On the first comment, I mean, you have seen our strategy, how we address the market. I mean, I cannot comment on what our competition
is doing. We feel good about our positioning with the promos we are coming out right now. And it actually resonate with our customers, the
migration path we have and all of that. So I don't think that you're going to see from us anything like that.

So on the BlueJeans and collaboration tools, we are integrating that every day here in new settings with new partners all the time because this is
a great asset. And we're scaling it right now as we acquired it. So that feels really good. And we still have the whole 5G area and the mobile edge
compute area, which is going to need video conferencing, et cetera, or communication services. So there's a lot more to be done there.

And we build that into the C-Band solutions, where Tami and her team are continuously working with our customers that want to migrate right
now. And we have great offerings in the market. So we feel good about that to be part of that transformation in the market, which is offsetting
some of the wireline secular declines that we see as well. So overall, I feel that we have a good position and a good work. Matt, anything more on
that?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

No, I think, look, the team has done a great job over the past 12 months. Remember, we closed this transaction during the pandemic. So the ability
to integrate and so on, we've done it all virtually and remotely. And so a lot of good work going on. And as you mentioned, Tim, it's the opportunity
for us to broaden the offerings that we have with our enterprise customers and some good traction there. So I think they've done everything we
expected to do at this point.

Operator

The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.

Frank Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research

Can you walk us through plans for the balance sheet? And then in particular, would you consider monetizing any assets like Verizon Media and so
forth to delever? And how we should think about the timing for delevering if that's changed at all since the Analyst Day?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Frank. Our capital allocation priorities are the same, as we said before. Number one, we will invest in our business. And I think we've
been very clear what we're investing in right now and the CapEx and the increased incremental CapEx for the C-Band.

Then secondly, we have clearly outlined we're going to put our Board in the position to continue to grow the dividend. Matt and I feel really
confident about that.

And then thirdly is to do as we did after the Vodafone acquisition, to come down again to pre-Vodafone, we call that pre-COVID or pre-C-Band
right now because we want change here or a little bit [fashionist]. So we're trying to -- we're doing that. And we see a great moment for that. And
we have basically a plan for that given how we're going to generate growth and cash flow over the years.

And as Matt outlined, when we spoke about this last time, 4 to 5 years is what we believe is going to take us to get there. So that's what we have
in play right now. And no other things are included or no other new updates neither. So we are just happy with the first quarter where we generated
very good cash, which means that the first quarter is in there for us to start doing our work to get back to the pre-C-Band sort of financial metrics.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, Hans, just building on that, the leverage is no change since the Investor Day. Good first quarter results. As you think about the revenue
targets we've given for the 5 years, certainly on track there.

The only other balance sheet update I'll give you is just on the cash balance. We've obviously had that at elevated levels since the start of the
pandemic. Given the progress we've seen since the start of the first quarter in terms of the vaccination rates in this country and then also the
stimulus getting passed, we didn't know if that was going to happen or not. And now having the auction behind us, we do think that there's the
opportunity for us to start moving cash to what was closer to something at a pre-pandemic level. So now that we've got all those things done and
we get into the second quarter here, we'll start work on that.

Operator

The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

Maybe just to follow up on that. Free cash flow was pretty strong in the quarter, $5.2 billion. It seems like there was some benefit on the working
capital side. Just curious if you could talk about how you see that progressing for the remainder of the year and might be implied in terms of free
cash flow for the year based on your target of 2.8 turns of leverage by year-end 2021.

And then secondly, I'm not sure if you'll be able to give it, but I'm curious if you can give us any color in terms of subscriber numbers for the fixed
wireless product at this point? And also just from a housekeeping perspective, what line item are you actually including subs if it's anywhere at all?
And then also, where is the revenue for that being shown?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Colby. So look, absolutely happy with the free cash flow performance in the first quarter. Obviously, working capital was part of the
benefit in there.

And as we look at that, there's a couple of things going in different directions. As we saw the increase in equipment volumes, we saw the device
payables, the receivables related to that increase. As you would expect, that was a benefit on cash flow last year. We said that would be a headwind
this year, hope to be a headwind this year, absolutely saw that.

Offsetting that a little bit was the volumes that we saw in March helped inventory levels. But also, we saw really good customer payments in the
month of March, too, as those stimulus payments hit. So as I think about cash flow for the rest of the year, I would expect the device receivables to
continue to be a little bit of a headwind as those return to a more normal level after the lower volumes last year.

And then obviously, we don't have cash tax payments in the first quarter. Those come through the final 3 quarters of the year. And as we mentioned,
we had a couple of favorable items in there last year. So still feel good, obviously, about where cash flow is going to play out. So no update on our
year-end leverage target at this point, but really nice to have a strong first quarter in the bank.

In terms of the fixed wireless access subscribers, as those expand, we'll start to disclose them. In terms of where the revenue shows up, you're seeing
that show up in service revenue as Fios broadband does today. So that's where the revenue will show up in the income statement.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

So it's actually in the Fios segment opposed to in the...

revenue. And then...

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

On the wireless side?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

It will be on the wireless service revenue, correct.

Operator

Your last question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.

Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst

So I guess on the margin front, when you look at the Consumer segment, you have a tailwind from Fios margins as that revenue stabilizes or
potentially starts flatlining due to broadband or even mix shifts away from video. And then as volumes pick up and you focus a bit more on volumes
over the course of this year, there's a tailwind -- I'm sorry, there's a headwind from that. So if you could just talk about the puts and takes when it
comes to margins over the course of the year in the Consumer business, that would be useful.

And then secondly, when you think about the stimulus that was passed in December, it looks like some of that money can flow to wireless consumers,
the subsidy. The $3 billion subsidy for broadband, I guess some of that could flow to wireless consumers as well. Are you guys starting to see some
of that impact? How big of a tailwind do you expect that to be in the second quarter?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Kannan. So on the Consumer margins, I think we've historically produced very good margins across the business there, and I'd expect
that to continue going forward. As you identified, there is always a number of puts and takes out there as we move forward. And certainly, Fios is
performing very well and is contributing nicely to that.

But as you also rightly pointed out, equipment volumes were up significantly year-over-year. And obviously, that increases the denominator in the
margin calculation without really increasing the numerator. So you've got a number of different puts and takes. You'll have the ongoing impacts
of building out the network in there as well. But we feel very good about the margins that we'll have for the rest of the year within Consumer, very
much in line with what you would expect.

And then certainly, the seasonality showing up in the fourth quarter with the seasonal volumes that you would expect to see over the course of
the holiday period. So certainly, to continue to be on track to give the -- to meet the EPS guidance we have for the year, Consumer margins need
to be a strong contributor to do that, and I expect them will be.

In terms of stimulus benefits, as I think I mentioned in the comment about working capital, we're seeing very good payment patterns from consumers
at this point. That's where I think we'll see the vast majority of any benefit show up. So those payments were very strong in the first quarter, and I
suspect the stimulus bills had something to do with that. But it means that our consumers are in very good shape as compared to where they

It is now my pleasure to turn over the call to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Thanks, Angela. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. 

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. 
A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 

Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements 
about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may 
affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 

This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable 
GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. 

In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.09 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items 
of approximately $1.5 billion. This includes a pretax loss of approximately $1.2 billion from early debt redemption costs. In addition, the impact of 
amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $238 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted 
earnings per share was $1.35 in the first quarter.

Thank you, Brady. Good morning, and thanks for joining us for this earnings call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day earlier in
Thank you, Brady. Good morning, and thanks for joining us for this earnings call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day earlier in
March. 

During the first quarter, the team stayed focused and continued to execute on our Network-as-a-Service strategy. This strategy underpins our 5 
vectors of growth and a diverse path to revenue growth that set us apart and sets up for today and tomorrow. To that end, I'm pleased with the 
progress we have made across our 5 vectors during the first quarter. We continued to make headway towards our long-term targets and delivered 
a solid start to the year, even in the face of competitive and macroeconomic pressures. Matt will go deeper on these topics later on. 

With that, let's get into the results at the high level. Our first quarter adjusted EPS results of $1.35 proves our ability to execute and deliver profitability. 
This demonstrates our unique position of having both a focused strategy and strong execution capabilities to meet the needs of our 4 stakeholders 
in the growing 5G economy. 

It all starts with our network expansion and execution. As you've heard me say many, many times, mobility, broadband and cloud are the essential 
pieces of the 21st century's infrastructure. We're already taking advantage of this infrastructure and capitalizing on an addressable market that is 
growing as consumers and businesses adopt 5G. We saw this growth in our wireless sales, our customer loyalty and the rapid expansion of our 
fixed wireless business in this quarter. 

Across the business, our wireless activations were up 11% year-over-year, and we delivered our best Q1 phone net add performance since 2018. 
Additionally, our fixed wireless started to benefit from the launch of C-Band during the quarter, helping to amplify our national broadband strategy 
and deliver our highest broadband net adds in over a decade. 

We continue to deploy C-Band rapidly, enabling more and more of our customers to enjoy our Ultra Wideband experience, while also accelerating 
and amplifying our 5G revenue opportunities. A strategic pillar in our network expansion is our C-Band build-out, which, combined with our 
continued millimeter wave rollout, further establishes and strengthens our network leadership, with RootMetrics ranking us again as the most 
reliable 5G network in the United States, and we have just started with the C-Band deployment. 

At the Super Bowl, we demonstrated the power of 5G to deliver new in-stadium and home experiences. For example, fans streaming the halftime 
show had access to multiple camera angles over our network to fully immerse in the entertainment experience, only something that can be done 
with 5G Ultra. This is just a taste of the new customer experience we and our partners are beginning to build on 5G Ultra. 

This is all based on a strong belief in giving our customers maximum optionality like mix and match, multi-cloud partners that allow our business 
customer choice for the digital transformation on 5G mobile edge compute, choice on premium experience with Verizon Up and choices of 
streaming services with exclusive deals only on Verizon. 

Just this week, we announced HBO Max will be offered on our +play platform. We're empowering our customers to choose the services they need 
and we're delivering on it. Our disciplined focus is reflected in our first quarter results as we saw continued momentum with step-ups and elevated 
device upgrades from our customers. 

As we previously mentioned, as technology megatrends further shift how we will work and live, 2022 is a year for Verizon to scale execution. The 
world continues to transition toward increased connectivity and the telecommunications industry's role in building our future has never been 
more vital. Through our key investments across our portfolio of assets, we will continue to build on our unique competitive position in the industry 
and drive growth across all of our 5 vectors. 

As we said before, 5G adoption is already much faster than what we saw when we changed from 3G to 4G. A year after 4G launched, less than 10% 
of the users had a compatible device. A year after the launch of 5G dynamic spectrum sharing, about 24% of our customers were on 5G devices.

proud to report that Tami and her team delivered the best quarterly phone net adds since we formed Verizon Business Group and they are just
getting started. 

We're also rapidly building our 5G mobile edge compute and private 5G networks. Verizon was first in the industry to offer MEC services. This 
quarter, we partnered with Cisco to deliver the low-latency connectivity necessary for autonomous vehicles. As a partner of choice across all 
categories, we also made our first 5G agreement with a premium global automaker, and we will bring 5G connectivity to the next generation of 
Audi models starting with their 2024 vehicles. 

This IoT momentum expands across all our verticals with another strong net add performance this quarter. We're also seeing very promising 
progress in our private 5G network capabilities, offering small, mid-market and large enterprise clients, turnkey plug-and-play services. I'm also 
pleased to share that our C-Band launch and aggressive execution, generating nationwide customer enthusiasm for our broadband offerings. 

Total new broadband customers were the highest in over a decade, with 229,000 net adds driven by a strong increase of 194,000 fixed wireless 
access net adds. And this is not a one-off. You can see from the current broadband trends that the demand for fixed wireless is extremely high and 
growing. 

In the consumer business, we grew postpaid average revenue per account by 2.6% as our users upgraded new 5G packages. ARPA growth is a 
major part of the strategy that we presented at the Investor Day. In the value market, the TracFone integration continues to unlock an addressable 
consumer market that we have only just scratched the surface on. We now have the ability to service customers in all segments regardless of the 
macroeconomic outlook. Manon and I are very encouraged by this opportunity and see tremendous value in the customer base Eduardo and his 
team have cultivated under the TracFone umbrella. 

The migration of TracFone subscribers from other networks continues according to plan. In addition to the result in 5G mobility, nationwide 
broadband, MEC and business-to-business and the value segment, we also see ongoing momentum in the fifth vector, network monetization, with 
growth in volumes driving incremental revenues. Of course, all of this opportunity is built on top of the best network in the industry and the 
deployment of our 5G Ultra Wideband technology. Kyle and team now have more than 35,000 millimeter wave sites on air and approximately 113 
million POPs covered at quarter end with C-Band. 

As deployment continues and device penetration ramps, traffic on our Ultra Wideband is increasing rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, 14% of 
all traffic in urban areas was on 5G Ultra, the result of our combined millimeter wave and mid-band spectrum. We saw a 35% increase in millimeter 
wave traffic between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. C-Band traffic grew 155% from the end of February to the end of March. Where C-Band is deployed, 
30% of our wireless traffic uses that spectrum. 

We have achieved this network evolution in the face of ongoing supply chain disruption. As I mentioned in previous quarters, our supply chain 
management is world-class. And we have planned and executed extremely well to anticipate and meet the needs of our customers. We continue 
to work with our partners with a focus on our deployment targets. 

We remain diligent in managing a complex global supply chain and count on our expertise to help us to deal with the unexpected. As you come 
to expect from our technology team, progress is being made throughout our network. In March, we announced a major milestone in the advancement 
of our 5G network as we work with 2 satellite companies to secure early clearing of an additional 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in 30 additional 
markets. Rolling out our C-Band service on this spectrum will expand our 5G market by 40 million potential customers, a full year ahead of schedule. 
We expect to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of 2022 on C-Band.

according to responsible business practices. 

Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. Today, we released our detailed environmental, social and governance report for 2021, and 
we are proud of our progress. The report covers our ESG strategy in detail and reflects how responsible business practices drive our business. During 
the first quarter, we completed allocating proceeds from our third green bond offering and issued our fourth $1 billion green bond, which is 
expected to be allocated towards renewable energy. We also continue to pursue our long-term carbon footprint goals, as described in previous 
quarters and in our ESG report. 

Third parties have taken notice. We continue to be recognized for our sustainability efforts. During the quarter, MSCI raised our ESG rating to AA, 
our highest rating to date. And Sustainalytics ranked us strong in ESG risk management and low in overall ESG risk, putting us above our U.S. 
telecom competitors. 

As always, what it means to be a responsible business depends on global conditions. I'm proud of Verizon's relief efforts to support Ukraine, including 
extending free calling to and from Ukraine since the start of the war. 

Taken together, Verizon remains well positioned to compete this year. Our first quarter performance puts us on track for this pivotal investment 
year and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term growth targets. 

Now I will hand the call over to Matt to address our results in detail as well as some updates on the 2022 guidance. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last month, we talked about 2022 as a critical year for scaling the business and 
making investments to position Verizon for the long term. And this quarter, we made progress along that path. 

At that event, we said we expect to generate an incremental $14 billion of service and other revenue from the business by 2025, and we expect to 
get there through leveraging our unique collection of assets against our 5 growth vectors. We expect over 75% of our growth over the next 4 years 
will come from 5G mobility and nationwide broadband, and our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our growth prospects. 

Our Consumer and Business units will measure success in mobility by how we perform in the areas of ARPA, premium unlimited penetration and 
subscribers and accounts. We've talked about our plans for increasing the value of our existing base of wireless customers through step-ups to 
higher-value data plans. The first quarter saw us achieve an increase in consumer postpaid ARPA of 2.6% year-over-year, positioning us for high-quality 
revenue and earnings growth going forward. 64% of new accounts selected premium unlimited, and together with continued step-up momentum, 
drove our premium penetration up to 36%. 

With respect to subscribers and new accounts, for the first quarter we reported postpaid phone net losses of 36,000, which represents an improvement 
of 142,000 or 80% from a year ago and our best first quarter performance since 2018. The performance was driven by our Business team, which 
contributed a record 256,000 phone net adds, the highest from the unit since Verizon 2.0 reporting began. These results were driven by strength 
in the 3 wireless customer groups as SMB, enterprise and public sector each delivered double-digit phone gross add growth and extended the 
momentum built in the second half of last year. We expect this strong performance to continue as we approach something closer to a pre-pandemic 
environment. 

On the Consumer side, phone net losses were 292,000 in the quarter. While churn was steady, we saw a decline in phone gross adds of 2% from 
the prior year. This gross add trend was more pronounced in March and is continuing into April. We will continue to take appropriate measures to

Consumer and Business segment performance in the nationwide broadband vector was strong and demonstrates the opportunity to scale this
business. We measure our success against this vector by households and businesses covered by broadband, and the total subscribers on our
business. We measure our success against this vector by households and businesses covered by broadband, and the total subscribers on our
networks. As Hans mentioned, the early clearance spectrum announcement is a major milestone for Verizon. Our network team is now able to 
deploy this spectrum a full year sooner than expected, unlocking another 40 million of addressable population. We feel confident that our C-Band 
network will cover at least 175 million POPs by the end of this year, and will cover 50 million households and 14 million businesses with fixed 
wireless access by the end of 2025. 

The addressable opportunity expansion continues in Fios as well, with 115,000 incremental open for sale in the quarter. We are seeing strong 
uptake in our broadband offers, and we expect increasing momentum as more and more people get access to our 5G Ultra Wideband and Fios 
service throughout the year. We had 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds across the portfolio, which is 2.5x our 4Q '21 performance. Consumers 
continue to see the benefit of the speed, reliability and simplicity of installation of the FWA product, and businesses continue to recognize that 
FWA can be a primary broadband access solution for all of their needs. 

For total broadband, we registered 229,000 net adds, representing our highest net adds in over a decade. Fios Internet contributed 60,000 net 
adds within the quarter driven by record low levels of churn. 

Now let's move on to the MEC and B2B solutions sector. Tami and the team continued to make great progress in this space. Within IoT, the team 
delivered another strong quarter of connection growth. We're seeing success across our verticals, working with our customers to deliver the 
solutions that they need. As we mentioned during our Investor Day, we anticipate that connections will continue to grow at a double-digit pace. 

With our investments in key partnerships, we continue to expand the ecosystem for MEC as well as advance our deployments in private wireless 
and private MEC. Our market differentiation is unmatched in terms of scale and capabilities and we are well positioned to accelerate our long-term 
revenue growth within this space. 

Now let's talk about the value market. Q1 marks the first full quarter of TracFone included in our Consumer results. Our integration of TracFone is 
going as planned, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. We measure our success in the value market based on prepaid ARPU, 
prepaid subscribers and prepaid revenue. Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of our prepaid brands. This declined in part because 
TracFone ARPU is lower than our legacy Verizon prepaid ARPU. Additionally, we saw quarter-over-quarter pressure, specifically in the TracFone 
brands, in part due to the transition from the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program to the Affordable Connectivity Program, which negatively 
impacted ARPU as benefits dropped from $50 to $30. Going forward, we expect prepaid ARPU to stabilize and subsequently grow as we execute 
on our strategy to bring additional value to this space. 

While we experienced certain device inventory pressure throughout the quarter, especially in January, the team finished strong and delivered first 
quarter volumes from TracFone that compared favorably to prior years excluding 2021 activity, which benefited from stimulus programs. Our 
TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of 77,000, while total Verizon prepaid net losses in the quarter were 80,000. 

Next, let's move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 14. On a consolidated basis, Verizon delivered strong wireless service revenue growth 
in a highly competitive environment in the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.5%, reflecting the first full quarter of TracFone 
ownership as well as continued execution of our Network-as-a-Service strategy and contributions from our 5 vectors of growth. 

Service and other revenue was down 2.5% in the quarter as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from 
TracFone. Excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, service and other revenue was up 4.2% from the prior year. 

Adjusted EBITDA was $12.0 billion for the quarter, down year-over-year by 1.1% due in part to elevated marketing expenses. We introduced our 
5G Ultra campaign at the beginning of the year to support our C-Band launch and FWA expansion. Combined with lower spending on the first 
quarter of 2021 driven by COVID-related impacts on our operations, marketing expenses represented a year-over-year drag on first quarter EBITDA

Q1.

As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $1.35, relatively in line with prior year. The bottom line performance shows 
the strength of our core business to deliver profitability even in a period of significant investment as well as other headwinds. 

Now let's take a look at our Consumer financial results in Q1. Total consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9% year-over-year, driven by the first 
full quarter of TracFone inclusion, higher equipment revenue and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 
11.2% year-over-year. These results were driven by the inclusion of TracFone as well as our increase in postpaid ARPA, which was driven by the 
strong step-up momentum I discussed earlier; and growth within our non-connectivity products and services. 

Moving to Fios services, we continued to see volume and rate gains with broadband offsetting pressures from video and voice as total Fios revenue 
grew 1.8%. Consumer EBITDA was $10.5 billion, up year-over-year by 1.0%. This growth is a result of the inclusion of TracFone as well as ARPA and 
customer volume gains, partially offset by the items mentioned earlier such as higher marketing expenses, investments in TracFone and higher 
bad debt, driven mainly by higher sales volumes in the quarter. 

Similarly, the higher sales activity resulted in elevated equipment revenue, pressuring EBITDA margins, which were 41.4% in the quarter. Margins 
were additionally pressured by the inclusion of the results of TracFone, which is a business that has historically operated with margins below the 
legacy Consumer business. 

Now let's take a closer look at the Business financial results on Slide 16. The Verizon Business Group continues to see strong wireless sales and 
service momentum within the Business space alongside the ongoing wireline service declines. Wireless service revenue growth of 2.1% was led 
by momentum in our SMB group, which continues to see strong post-pandemic recovery. The rate of growth is an improvement from last quarter's 
1.5%. And with 1Q last year representing the peak for distance learning devices, we expect business wireless service revenue growth to expand 
over the rest of 2022. 

Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 9.3% from the prior year. The decline in EBITDA was driven in part by the ongoing reduction 
in high-margin wireline revenue. Additionally, we experienced elevated levels of subsidy related to the strong wireless Q1 sales volume, which 
were up 20% year-over-year. EBITDA margin was 22.5%, similarly impacted by wireline service trends and wireless sales volumes. 

Let's move to Slide 17, the cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion compared with $9.7 billion 
from the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted 
receivables and inventory increased as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. 

Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to last year driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion. 

The continued build-out of One Fiber and our investment to support growth of traffic on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and 
capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network greatly extends our opportunity to effectively compete in all of our businesses. The net result of cash 
flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $1.0 billion. 

We exited the quarter with $135.6 billion of net unsecured debt, an increase of $1.9 billion sequentially as we issued our fourth green bond with 
the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, we completed a number of other transactions during the quarter, the 
proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost long-term debt. 

We ended the quarter with a net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8x, flat on a sequential basis as expected.

and expect those to continue given the current environment. The major areas of exposure for us are energy-related costs for our network operations
and transportation as well as labor-related costs, including both our direct workforce and third parties.
and transportation as well as labor-related costs, including both our direct workforce and third parties.

While these items have not had a significant impact on our overall results to date, they represent a meaningful portion of our direct cost structure 
and have the potential to drive additional expense pressures throughout the rest of the year. We also believe that the inflation we have seen 
throughout the economy may alter both the consumer and business landscape in which we compete. It is too early to predict how this changed 
landscape may impact our near-term results or how long it will last, but we are confident that the strategy we have put in place will allow us to 
achieve our long-term growth plans. 

There has also been a significant increase in treasury yields recently. But as a reminder, the vast majority of our debt, approximately 75% to 80%, 
is fixed rate. The team has kept near-term maturities in the next 12 to 24 months at manageable levels, which also helps minimize near-term interest 
rate exposure. If the present forecast of Fed rate hikes are accurate, we anticipate an incremental cash interest impact for the year above our earlier 
expectations of $150 million to $200 million. 

Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. On the revenue side, we now anticipate service and other revenue 
to be approximately flat to 2021. Significant items affecting our service and other revenue include USF rate reductions which are pressuring 
year-over-year revenue by several hundred million dollars and softness in wireline sales. 

We are keeping the guidance ranges of wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Based upon our expectations around service 
and other revenue as well as the macroeconomic pressures, we now expect to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance ranges for 
these items. For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business-as-usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion for 
C-band-related spending. We will continue to invest in the business and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities discussed during 
our Investor Day. 

With that, I'll turn it over to Hans to close out our 2022 priorities. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you, Matt. Our priority for 2022 is to continue to execute on our Network-as-a-Service strategy and to drive growth across all our 5 vectors. 
This is a critical year for scaling on our strategic investment as we work to capture all of the promise that 5G offers, both from a customer experience 
perspective and for our future revenue growth. 

We made good progress in this quarter and continue to execute on our long-term plans. Our core business and our strategy showed strength, and 
we have a solid momentum going into the second quarter, all built on the strong confidence in our strategy. 

Now we're ready to take your questions. Back to you, Brady. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Thanks, Hans. Angela, we're ready for questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.
(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst 

I guess 2 quick follow-ups to all the data you guys provided. First off on the EBB reimbursements. Is the impact to ARPU that we saw, the $5 change, 
does that fully reflect the changes in reimbursements? And is there any impact from a customer standpoint? 

And then on Consumer margins, they were down 400 basis points. Is that -- can you separate out the impact from TracFone had and sort of 
underlying trends and what was driving that? And just your outlook for how that should trend through the year. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

John, thanks for the questions. On the EBB messaging there, there's certainly -- we're seeing that change in the programs as we go forward here, 
but no major impact on customer volumes related to that. 

I think your bigger question on Verizon Consumer Group and the margins we saw in the quarter. So a couple of major things in there, certainly 
some onetime increases in costs as we look at the quarter. We were very, very strong on our marketing spend this quarter with the launch of C-Band, 
new price plans, launch of fixed wireless on C-Band as well and everything around that. So that's in the quarter. We would expect that to be returned 
to more normal levels as we head here into second quarter and go forward. 

And then of course, you saw the volumes up year-over-year, that has some impact in there. And then Trac, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 
that has an impact. Initially, that's going to be in the 100 to 200 basis point range impact as you bring Trac into the overall VCG mix. And then as 
we work through the integration and bring all of the customers in Trac onto our network, that impact will lessen as we complete the integration 
over the next 12 to 24 months. 

So a combination of things in there. But certainly we'd expect to see a little bit of a slight uptick as we head into the rest of the year here on the 
Consumer margin. 

Operator 

Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. 

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst 

So during your prepared remarks, I think you had noted that postpaid phone gross adds had started to soften towards the end of the quarter, and 
that had continued into 2Q. I was hoping you could let us know what insights you've gained into what's behind that? In other words, to what extent 
do you think it has to do with lower market volumes, or perhaps a shift in porting ratios and some of the steps that you're going to be implementing 
to sort of stabilize that? 

And then just on the cash flow. Matt, to what extent was the higher working capital use in the first quarter really a timing issue? Obviously, pre-buying 
inventory to manage the supply chain seems like a timing factor. But I guess with regards to just the elevated volumes, do you expect to ultimately 
have that offset either by selling off the receivables or just collecting the payments? Or was any of that actually associated with maybe a little bit 
more of a device promotion profile in the first quarter?

First of all, I mean, if you look at the quarter, we had a very good wireless net add quarter of course, because if you look at the combination, our
Business side was very strong. Consumer also had a good quarter, but a little bit slowness as we said in the prepared remarks in March. 

However, if you think about it, it's logical. I mean, the competition is higher as we have seen now for a while because we're coming into the second 
phase of the 5G era and the acquisition of 5G customers are sort of an important piece in the market. And what we see is, of course, a really good 
traction for us. 

I mean our churn levels are still very low. We're doing well. We're doing upgrades and step-ups all the time. So -- and that's our focus. Then, of 
course, as we always say, we look into the market, and we will take measured actions if it's needed that we have done all the time, and being very 
financially disciplined when we come into the market with new offerings and see if there is something we need to do. 

But right now, I feel really good where we are. We're actually -- with our launch of our Ultra in the beginning of the year, it's really kept -- made us 
in a total different situation because our network is just fantastic. And that's what we see from our customers, both on fixed wireless access and 
both on Consumer and Business. 

And this was the whole strategy we laid out and when we met in the beginning of March when it comes to our overall long-term strategy. So now 
I'm pleased with what I see then is going to that would be a competitive market, but that's how it is. And I think it's very logical. And partly, we are 
sort of coming out with some strong offerings, mix and match and all of that. So the market is responding to it. So yes, I feel good about the strategy. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. And Brett, your question on cash flows, you -- in your question, you used a phrase a timing factor in here, and I think absolutely, that's part of 
what we're seeing. 

So a couple of things on the receivables side. With the last couple of years, we actually had some tailwinds associated with some of the impacts of 
the lower volumes that came through as we went through the pandemic. And now we're seeing those volumes return to more normal levels, which 
creates a temporary headwind. But it's really just getting back to where we were. 

You think about device payment levels. Those are certainly up year-over-year. As we said, activations were up in the quarter, 11%. Therefore, we 
have more device loans on the balance sheet, but it's really getting back to those pre-pandemic levels rather than anything else. We saw an actual 
benefit in core customer payments that helped the year ago number with all the subsidy money out there. That was a onetime benefit that we're 
lapping. Customer payments continue to be incredibly strong, so we're very pleased with that. 

And then the inventory side, as we've managed through some of the disruptions that we've seen there, we've taken advantage of the balance 
sheet strength we have to run at higher-than-normal inventory levels. But obviously, I would be looking to have us return to more normal levels 
on that over time here. 

So I expect those to be just timing factors, as you said in your question, and continues to be very confident in the overall strength of the cash flows 
that this business produces.

typically manage towards?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. There's certainly a little bit of an increase, and it is largely what you see in the inventory side of the balance sheet there coming from handsets 
and so on. So there is a little bit more cushion in there in the system, so to speak, which we think is appropriate given the environment that everyone 
is operating in. 

But it's certainly something that we think gives us a good position in the marketplace. And as supply chains become more predictable again, going 
forward, we'll adjust that accordingly.

The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. 

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst 

Sorry, I want to follow up on the last question around the sort of wireless industry and gross add softness in March and April. So you've ramped up 
your wireless promotions for consumer, which looks more like addressing a churn issue, which I don't think is what you're calling out. Do you think 
that softer gross adds is a share issue or is that an industry slowdown issue? 

And then second, sort of related, how does that impact your thoughts on inflation? And it sounds like AT&T is trying to signal prices higher. How 
do you think about the potential of this industry to be raising prices at the margin for consumers if we do see inflation starting to creep up? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thanks, Phil. I'll start with the overall macro, and maybe Matt will fill in a little bit about the gross adds, the other question you had. 

On the inflation, I mean as Matt said in the prepared remarks, I mean we haven't seen so much impact so far of it. But of course, this is high in 40 
years on inflation. So we are planning for all scenarios. We have plans to be prepared for what it takes. So that will, of course, include different type 
of cost adjustments, but also looking into what we can do with pricing. 

But again, we don't know how this will impact us. But clearly, these levels of inflation, we have never seen before in the wireless industry. So of 
course, that also -- the measurements need to be thought through in a good way. And we are doing that, and we have already plans ready for it. 
So we're going to see what's going to happen. But clearly, we are in a moment in the economy where we really don't know how this is going to 
impact finally. But the levels are, of course, very high when it comes to inflation. Matt? 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes, Phil. So your question around just what we're seeing there. Look, I would tell you that there is nothing that we see in the data that suggests 
any change in share out there. I certainly believe there has been a bit of a downtick in overall foot traffic, not just in our stores, but up and down 
the high street. But our share continues to be where we would expect it to be.

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. 

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD 

I wonder if we could talk about fixed wireless. Earlier in the quarter, you talked about doubling your Q4 numbers, and you came in well ahead of 
that. I think you talked about wherever you open it up, there's some strong demand. So perhaps just give us some color as -- has the adds been 
accelerating through the quarter. So is this a good jumping off point for Q2 for the rest of the year? 

And maybe just address, you still got that $25 price point out. How are we thinking about how long that lasts and what the footprint is today and 
what it's going to be once you light up some of those more markets by the end of the year? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thanks, Simon. No, no. This is, of course, one of the 5 vectors of growth that we are very focused on. And clearly, you'll see the momentum growing 
for us even since we met in the beginning of March. So clearly, as we turn on more and more houses and businesses for sale, we have a good 
sell-through. And the quarter was, of course, good for us. And we're coming in with the momentum into the next quarter is really good. 

Then of course, as we say, we're now deploying sort of the C-Band in urban and suburban. Millimeter wave is in urban, LTE is in rural. So that is 
really now also where the customers are coming on to. But clearly, our C-Band is coming quicker in here, we're going to have even more opportunities. 
And as you heard me saying in my prepared remarks there, we now also have an additional 30 markets that we'll have early clearing on this year, 
which gives us even more frequencies, 100 megahertz. 

So this is adding all to this momentum we have. And remember, we have been working on this for a while. We know how to do it all the way from 
in the sort of provisioning of the network, capacity management, billing and propositions. And that comes to the pricing as well. I think we have 
a good pricing at the moment with a combined offering and also the stand-alone offering, and we see that making a good sort of wave in the 
market. 

But as always, we will always look into what is the right price point, which is the right type of value we're giving our customers. I think we are giving 
a great value, and that's what we see in the numbers. So yes, we have a great momentum coming out from the quarter going into this quarter, and 
we will continue to hammer this as we're hammering all the 5 vectors of growth constantly to see that we are reaching our long-term ambitions 
that we outlined in the beginning of this -- in the beginning of March, I think, that was our Investor Day. It was some time ago. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. So just a couple of things to add on that. So Simon, as you think about the volumes we had in the first quarter, remember, that's not a full 
quarter of C-Band. That came on in middle of January. And of course, you have that time period where the sales teams are building up the sales 
motion of selling a new product. So I certainly think that we can continue to see good numbers there as we go through the rest of the year, and 
we're just getting started with what you saw, the 194,000 in the first quarter. 

And from a pricing standpoint, as Hans said, it's -- you should think about it that, that price point you mentioned is for a customer who's also taking 
wireless products from us as well. On a stand-alone basis, it's higher priced. But we'll continue to look at the pricing proposition and maximize both 
the value for customers, but also the opportunity for us as well.

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.
The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD 

I guess my first question would be with respect to fixed wireless access, if we look at your numbers and the numbers that T-Mobile's preannounced, 
it feels like fixed wireless access is going to be more than half the normal broadband net adds in a quarter in a normal year. And that has to be 
putting some pressure on the cable industry to respond, unless there's a reason or an escape valve that exists because of maybe the Affordability 
Connectivity Program or something. So I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about how you think the wireline broadband dynamic 
is going to evolve with cable and how they respond potentially in the wireless market? 

And the second would be -- a question, if I could, maybe Hans, there was a time when Verizon had the best network and charged the highest prices 
and took the most market share. And on these kinds of calls, we would talk about whether -- the question was really whether we wanted to give 
a little margin or take a little market share. You guys are now a share donor every quarter. And we're celebrating how many 5G phones we have 
and how many C-Band we're deploying. But it's not obvious that, that's translating into something tangible that investors can celebrate in terms 
of financial reward. So can we talk a little bit about that too? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Yes. If we start with the fixed wireless access, I mean, I can talk for ourself, but I'm not sure what the response will be from someone. But this is a 
high-quality product. The usage of the fixed wireless access is very similar to our Fios users. So this is a primary usage in the vast majority of all the 
cases when it comes to our fixed wireless access. 

So this is a high-quality product that definitely is going to compete very well in the market. And in our case, as we have said before, this means 
that we are nationwide with our broadband as we're expanding our C-Band and can address more and more households. That doesn't mean that 
we lose our focus on our Fios footprint because that is a very strong product in the ILEC we have. And you saw this quarter, again, we're doing well 
and continue to grow our Fios. And this year, we're going to have more open for sale on the Fios. 

So for us, is we create optionalities, but we only create high-quality products that we believe that the customer wants and then that we are 
supporting. So that's why I feel good about our whole national broadband strategy that we laid out in the previous -- in the first quarter. So I'm 
really pleased with that. 

The second question, I think that when we look at our business, and I think we talked very well about it at our Investor Day. Our focus is to, over 
time, grow this business with 4%. And that we do with different levers. And of course, based on the best network in the nation, no doubt about 
that. And our network is just improving. And we have just started our C-Band, so we are super excited over the network we have. 

And then on top of that, of course, the different type of investments we have done in order to grow, and to grow the 4%. And that, I think, shareholders 
should be excited over. And that's what you see in this quarter as well. We are actually executing on those levers. We are ahead of plan on certain 
of the vectors, which is great to see. And that will translate both the top line and the bottom line, as we outlined in our Investor Day. 

So that's how I see it. And we will continue to see that we are a premium brand. But remember, nowadays, we can actually play in all fields on the 
wireless, all the way from the sort of the prepaid to the high-end premium and meet any type of conditions in the market with our portfolio, which 
is enormous strength. And on top of that, we have a scale of economy on all our offerings because we own our network, we have built our network 
and all of that. 

So I feel really good with all I have to say and where we're going, and we're going to compete well. I mean I just can tell you that, we feel good 
about it. Matt?

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. 

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst 

Two questions. First, I'm just curious if you're seeing different performance of gross adds, handset upgrades and rate plan mix when you look at 
your C-Band markets and your non-C-Band markets? And maybe you can unpack some of that difference, if there is any? 

And then secondly, just going back to some of the comments around guidance. You mentioned some of the possible sensitivities to the operating 
environment. But I was curious if you could be more specific when you describe lower end of the ranges for wireless service revenue growth, EBITDA 
and EPS, what specifically is in each of those updated levels of guidance commentary? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

I can start with the C-Band. Yes, for obvious reasons, we see more excitement in the markets where we are turning on the C-Band and also some 
more upgrades. But remember, we are just in the beginning of the C-Band and we started with it in the in the midst basically of the quarter. So 
we're there at the beginning. 

But clearly, when our customers and consumers see the C-Band turned on, they see enormous performance on the network, and that's easier to 
make a big difference all the time. So far, it may be not so much. But clearly, the excitement is out there. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

On the guidance, Mike, so as you think through it in terms of the lower end of the range on wireless service revenue, part of that is obviously, as 
we see the nature of the competitive environment, but it's also the volumes that you see us delivering and some of the impacts of that. 

So excited by 11% increase in activations year-over-year, that shows strong interest from our customers. But that, of course, does mean that we 
see the amortization impact from promo come through the wireless service revenue. And so we'll see that impact there. 

That, of course, will also impact the EBITDA guidance. But the EBITDA guidance also has our views on inflation as well as we think about the year 
as a whole. And certainly, those views have evolved over the past 90 days for everyone as well. And then -- so obviously, EBITDA impacts the EPS 
guidance, and the EPS also has the interest expense that I commented on in my prepared remarks, that it's probably a low single-digit impact on 
an EPS basis that we'll see come through as a result of higher Fed hikes than was probably in people's plans at the start of the year. 

So a number of factors impacting each of those items. We still feel very confident in the results of the business we will produce this year and the 
momentum that we're building in the year across the growth vectors to deliver the long-term aspirations that we all have.

on wireless year-over-year, 40,000 more accounts this year than at this time a year ago. So the PxQ there works. 

But this comes back to what we talked about at the Investor Day, having 5 vectors of growth. And really what we talked about there is just one of 
them. In addition to that, obviously, we've got fixed wireless access kicking in now, 194,000 net adds in the first quarter, over 400,000 in the base. 
That's exactly in line with what we said you should see with increasing the base this year. And therefore, that having a more meaningful impact 
on revenue in '23, but we're building that base now in line with what we've said. 

And then you laid out the things like MEC and obviously, on the not just within the B2B space, mobile edge compute, but also as we get into the 
5G world, the scope of opportunity for IoT and machine-to-machine continues to increase, and we talked about the momentum we have there. 
And that's just really getting started. 

On the prepaid side, we continue to see the integration of TracFone going as expected, and we expect that to add value as we go forward here. 
And then we continue to see growth in our network monetization vector too. So we still feel very confident that we have the ability to grow across 
more vectors and other people. That starts with mobility and it extends into the other one. But absolutely, I think you'll see growth across all of 
those. Hans? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

No, I think that just adding on the mobile edge compute and we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks. But clearly, we see the market now with 
the whole ecosystem coming in there, and we, as the pioneer and the leader in the market, definitely have more engagement than we have ever 
had before. 

Pivoting a little bit to private networks in the beginning, 5G private networks, and then you build on the mobile edge compute on that. So now, I 
see this as a traditional B2B. And not only that, it's definitely clearly a way for us to build new relationship with our enterprise customer. 

But I said before, this year, we are building that funnel. We're making it. And of course, when it comes to meaningful revenue or a little bit higher, 
that's going to be more next year. So -- but clearly, this year, we're going to talk a lot about and show you what we're doing, the solutions we have. 

And remember also, we have the smaller solution for SMBs when it comes to private 5G networks. We see so many use cases. And remember, all 
is built on how we built the network from the beginning where we basically, from the data center to the edge of the network, have one unified 
network, which is fiberized. And then at the edge of the network, we can do different solutions for different type of customer groups. This is going 
to pay off big time the next 5 to 10 years. And I feel really good about how we have built the network. And seeing also the importance of mobility, 
broadband and cloud in our society for businesses and people, I think we're so well placed in this. So I feel good about it.

The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.
The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.

Doug Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD
Doug Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD

I'm just curious on the long-term ambition to build out C-Band. Your Phase I and Phase II is pretty clear through 230 million POPs. Is there attractive 
returns building out C-Band beyond that? Is there a Phase III? And what's the time frame for that? Just trying to get a line of sight on the long-term 
capital intensity. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Yes, it is more ambition to continue. When it comes to our capital intensity, I think we outlined that very clearly that we will have the peak year 
now, then we're coming down. And then in '24, '25, we will have a BAU that is below 12%, with of course, over a decade, the lowest we've had. But 
that is coming from the investment levels we have done and prepared the network. 

In there, of course, we have the BAU expansion of C-Band. So that's clear. And already right now, as you know, we have moved up. So now we will 
have doing at least 175 million POPs covered this year. And then, of course, that means also that other pieces of the network will come earlier. And 
topping that with so far, we're only using 60 megahertz. Now we're adding 100 megahertz in the next 30 markets. But remember, in average, we 
are 161 megahertz nationwide. And in many and mostly in the rural areas, we're up to 200 megahertz. 

So of course, we invested in this spectrum in order to be extremely competitive and do things that nobody else can do. So we're going to continue 
to do it, but that doesn't change the profile that Matt and I laid out when it comes to capital intensity, that's included. But clearly, we're going to 
take advantage of the investments we have done. And the sooner we do it, the better it is. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. Doug, just to add on to that a little bit. If you think about network usage and customers' demand on the network continues to grow year-over-year. 
That's true across every geography. So you should expect no difference in how we think about C-Band rollout to get 5G Ultra Wideband to all of 
our customers the same way we did with LTE rollout a decade ago. 

And as you saw with the LTE rollout, as we got out of the initial launch areas to more nationwide, we did that within our overall CapEx envelope. 
And that's what we've described that you should expect from us as we do the same thing with the C-Band and get the 5G experience to all of our 
customers as soon as possible here. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Angela, we've got time for one more question. 

Operator 

Your last question comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. 

Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Senior Analyst 

I guess, first, I wanted to ask you if you've seen any change in the composition of your postpaid phone gross add mix over the past few quarters in 
terms of different segments of the market, both in Consumer and Business.

you giving any consideration to accelerating that pace over the next few years given what seemed to be improving economics for fiber broadband
across the industry? Or do you think that fixed wireless is just a better way to approach the vast majority of your ILEC footprint that hasn't been 
upgraded to Fios? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

I can start with the second one, because I remember it, and I will come to the wireless customers. 

So on the Fios, you're right, 550,000 open for sale this year, which is an increase from 2021. And we will continue to look for opportunities to expand 
as our customers are loving the product. So there are no limitation on that. That's, of course, the focus is in the ILEC where we're doing the expansion. 
Outside that, we're predominantly working with fixed wireless access. 

So ultimately, we want to give high-quality products on broadband that can be used for everything you need in a home or in a business, and that's 
what we are catering for, either through fixed wireless access and Fios. So we're going to continue to see if we accelerate depending on customer 
demand. But clearly, as we're increasing Fios this year compared to last year, we see that happening. And our capture rate on Fios is, of course, 
magnificent. It's great. We're really strong on it. 

When it comes to the wireless customers, and I guess I don't 100% remember the question, so Matt will probably support me at the end there. But 
one thing that we need to remember, the strength of SMB, for example, that we have had now for many quarters, that is clearly a segment that is 
doing well on wireless. 

Then on the same time, as Matt has said, we see our customers continue to do upgrades and step ups, that is part of our strategy. And that we're 
seeing in our base constantly. So I don't think that is a big difference from previous quarters where we've seen before. But I'm not sure. Maybe, 
Matt, you have something more on that. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. So on the comments about March and April volumes, those are predominantly on the Consumer side, nothing particular in terms of breaking 
the Consumer apart there in terms of particular areas. But as Hans said, the VBG side, Verizon Business Group continues to do very strong performance 
across small business, enterprise, public sector, double-digit growth in gross adds across each of those parts of Tami's business in the first quarter, 
and that was really fairly even throughout the quarter. 

So we saw a little lower foot traffic on the Consumer side. But the Business side continues to perform at a very even level throughout the quarter 
as we head into Q2 here. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Angela, we're ready to finish the call.

within the business segment have been recast to reflect these changes. You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor
Relations website.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call 2023. We delivered a solid first quarter marked by strong
performance as we continue to execute on our plan to grow the business across mobility, broadband and private networks. We're making steady
progress and expect to keep up the momentum going forward. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue,
EBITDA and free cash flow. We grew total postpaid phone gross adds by 5% year-over-year this quarter and achieved 3% wireless service revenue
growth, $11.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA as well as a strong cash flow from operations of $8.3 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion versus the prior
year.

We're working every day to move the business forward by using the power of America's most reliable network to deliver the best experience for
our customers. During the quarter, we reached more than 200 million POPs covered by C-band in just over a year since we lit up the first site. With
access to that spectrum and advancing the build-out as quickly as we did, we have enabled new source of revenue growth and elevated our
customers' overall wireless experience.

In the first quarter, J.D. Power recognized us as the most awarded for network quality for the 30th time in a row. We're seeing improvements in
already leading network performance validated by year-to-date RootMetrics testing and our customers are taking notice. Where we offer C-band,
we see significant benefits in fixed wireless access, consumer phone gross adds and retention as well as premium take rates. We also see 4G
customers benefiting as we offload traffic in some markets to our 5G Ultra Wideband network. The performance improvements will continue as
5G penetration expands market by market.

We're excited about the remaining deployment of C-band spectrum and the potential it will unlock for both our business and consumer performance.
Moving on to mobility. On the business side, even in the current economic conditions, my peers across different industries have conveyed confidence
that mobility remains a priority in their spending. During the first quarter, Verizon business continued its run of strong performance, delivering
136,000 postpaid phone net adds. This was accomplished in spite of some pressures around restructurings within the technology sector.

On the consumer side, payment trends are at healthy pre-COVID levels and consumers are shopping, evidenced by our increase in consumer
postpaid phone gross adds, which were up 11% year-over-year, with the new to Verizon adds leading the way. Our gross add performance is proof
that our surgical and segmented approach to the market is working. We're in a much better position than a year ago, entering the second quarter
with a sustained momentum around gross adds as well as postpaid churn where we saw improved performance each month across the first quarter.

We remain committed to our strategy, not to compete on who can discount the most, but rather who can offer the most value to customers, the
best overall experience and the best customer satisfaction. +play is a great example of this. We listened to our consumers and introduced exciting
partners like Peloton and Netflix providing exclusive deals on an easy-to-use subscription managed platform, and there is more to come. Our
segmented approach to the market recognizes that one plan doesn't fit all, and we have continued the work to address our underperforming
segments. I've talked about our efforts to be more targeted and surgical with our retention. And we saw that play out during the quarter.

By reducing upgrade volumes and lowering inefficient spending, we were able to deliver working capital benefits while finishing the quarter in a
good place with churn and executing on migrations to premium unlimited. Those are real cash savings and a key driver to the large year-over-year
improvements in free cash flow. You have seen us taking pricing action most recently on some of our legacy unlimited plans. We continue to look
across our base and evaluate opportunities to more closely align pricing to our value proposition. On prepaid, we are working diligently to realize
the full potential of this segment. While net adds were down by more than 
 the prior 
year, this total was affected by 2 transitory

[270,000](corrected by company after the call) versus

factors.

APRIL 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

First, more than 100% of our net year-over-year decline came from higher disconnects within our SafeLink brand, which provides services to
customers on government subsidized programs. We're still in process of migrating customers onto our network as well. Prepaid is an important
part of our value segment strategy and our investments here will continue as we're confident they will pay off in the long term.

Turning to broadband, which is a major growth area for us across consumer and business. We achieved the highest net adds in over 10 years,
adding 437,000 total net adds within the quarter, including 67,000 net adds from Fios. We are very pleased with the Fios performance with net
adds up 12% year-over-year. For fixed wireless access, we're seeing growth quarter after quarter after quarter with 1.9 million subscribers at the
end of the first quarter, fixed wireless continues to scale and contribute increasingly to our revenue performance.

Our business customers are increasingly turning to fixed wireless access as their primary source of broadband connectivity. Won over by the
reliability and the overall value of the product. In addition to taking share from our competitors, we're also seeing new use cases across all of our
customer groups leveraging the flexibility of the product to expand beyond what traditional wired broadband can do.

Finally, in private networks, our Verizon business team continues to execute at a high level. We announced new deals with KPMG and Deloitte and
have a strong funnel of business ahead of us. We have also established a leadership position as a top network provider in the public sector. This
quarter, we announced a 15-year critical infrastructure contract with the FAA worth over $2 billion to design, build and operate and maintain the
FAA's next-generation communication platform. This is in addition to many ongoing projects we're working on for large federal agencies.

In creating the networks that move the world forward, we remain committed to running our business responsibly for our customers, shareholders,
employees and society. Last month, we published our 2022 ESG report, which highlights how business ethics, governance, environmental stewardship
and human rights are at the center of everything we do.

I encourage you to take some time to review the report and learn about how we are managing risk and unlocking opportunities surrounding the
issues of utmost importance for our stakeholders. Our commitments here come right from our leaders and their teams. A few weeks ago, I announced
new leadership for our 2 business units, the network organization and our Chief Financial Officer. These leaders come with nearly 100 years of
experiences within Verizon and bring a proven track record of successful execution.

Let me take a moment to walk through these changes. Sampath takes over as a CEO of Verizon Consumer. His objectives are clear: to enhance our
consumer operation model and experience, deepen our segmentation approach, scale fixed wireless access and broadband and drive financial
discipline. Kyle Malady was appointed CEO of Verizon Business. CIOs are increasingly searching for technology reach solutions, and nobody knows
our technology like Kyle.

His focus is clear: drive sustainable growth in mobility and deliver on the revenue growth opportunities within fixed wireless, 5G private wireless
and mobile edge compute solutions. Joe Russo takes over as President of Global Networks and Technology to continue our efforts to extend,
enhance and solidify the nation's leading wireless network and vast global IP and fiber network. Finally, Matt Ellis leaves us at the end of the month,
after 10 years at Verizon and 6 years as our CFO. I want to thank him for his many contributions to our business.

Tony Skiadas assumed the title of Chief Financial Officer on May 1. I appreciate Tony's work to improve operations and drive performance as we
search for a long-term CFO replacement. So let's now move on, in talking about efficiencies. The teams are on the way to deliver better, simpler
and more efficient end-to-end processes for our customers and employees. Spearheaded by the Verizon Global Services Group, we're looking into
numerous areas across the business that will help drive bottom line growth, including IT platform transformations, building advanced AI models
for the better diagnostic and predictive insights, optimizing our real estate footprint and managing our supply chain efficiently.

We have also reduced headcount over the last quarters. All in all, our cost efficiency program is on track to achieve our target of $2 billion to $3
billion of annual savings by 2025, which will help to fund our growth as well as drive margin improvements over time. With almost all our $10
billion C-band capital expenditure program behind us, we expect our cash generation profile to expand over the next few years, driven by revenue
growth, cost management and efficiencies with capital expenditures. This helps support our objective to achieve consistent dividend growth with
our 16 consecutive years of increases currently the longest streak in the industry.

As we look to build on the free cash flow growth generated in the first quarter, we expect to see significant improvement in our dividend payout
ratio this year putting the board in a strong position to increase the dividend once again and bring us closer to our debt targets over the following
years. Going into the second quarter, I'm energized by the execution of the Verizon team and our new leadership across key positions. We remain
focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow expansion.

And with that, I will now turn it over to Matt for the last time.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the first quarter reflect the steps we have taken to improve our performance. C-band and the
investments in our network are having a positive benefit on customer and overall network experiences. And as Hans mentioned, we are seeing a
direct benefit around fixed wireless and phone gross adds, among other metrics, where we operate C-band, but more work remains to be done.
Taking a look at operating results of the first quarter, let's start with consumer postpaid phones, which had 263,000 net losses for the quarter
compared to 292,000 net losses for the prior year period. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds was strong across the quarter, up over 11%
year-over-year, continuing the momentum from the second half of last year.

Our efforts around the segmentation of our base and our more targeted go-to-market approach and offerings to those different customer groups
have been key drivers behind our improved gross adds performance. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.84% and up 7 basis
points compared to the same period last year. We are now seeing a return of involuntary churn rates to pre-pandemic levels. As for voluntary churn,
performance was mixed across the quarter starting off elevated as we saw normal holiday season activity extend into the early parts of the first
quarter.

But as the quarter progressed, we saw improvements in terms of year-over-year churn performance, exiting in the quarter with voluntary churn
rates in line with last year. While we have more work to do to improve consumer net adds, we are encouraged by the double-digit percentage
improvement in gross adds combined with the improved churn level at the end of the first quarter. We entered the second quarter with significantly
better momentum than a year ago.

Moving on to the business segment. Verizon Business again delivered strong results. We saw solid demand across our 3 customer groups and had
136,000 phone net adds for the first quarter compared to 256,000 for the same period last year. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a
couple of large deals that contributed to our net adds results a year ago. Additionally, we saw an increase in churn due to business customers being
more cautious around spending and the restructurings Hans noted in his remarks.

Moving along to broadband on a consolidated basis, we delivered 437,000 net additions in the first quarter, the most in a decade. As expected, we
saw another quarter of sequential growth in fixed wireless with 393,000 net adds, up from 379,000 in the prior quarter. Customer satisfaction
remains high as evidenced by NPS scores as well as encouraging churn trends around the more tenured cohorts of customers. On the Fios side,
Internet net adds for the first quarter was 67,000 and up from 60,000 in the first quarter of last year.

Customers continue to be attracted to our high-quality broadband products, which is reflected in the year-over-year increase in Fios gross adds
even in an environment with lower move volumes versus the prior year.

Fios retention rates continue to be strong with our best churn performance in more than 5 years. While the first quarter results were prepaid were
below our expectations, we remain confident in the value market opportunities and the benefits of having a portfolio of assets and plans that
satisfy the needs of all of our customers.

You heard from Hans some of the actions we are taking to create long-term value. As expected, in the short term, these actions are having a negative
impact on our prepaid net adds. Together with the elevated disconnects and our SafeLink brand that Hans referenced, we expect pressure on

APRIL 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Moving on to the financials. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $32.9 billion, down 1.9% year-over-year primarily due to equipment revenue
being lower by 9% as well as continued declines in business wireline services. Wireless service revenue was $18.9 billion, up 3.0% year-over-year.

As we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, results for the first quarter included a benefit of approximately 185 basis points associated
with the large allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue. This benefit was partially
offset by the impact associated with the shutdown of our 3G network completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The shutdown resulted in the
removal of approximately 1.1 million retail connections and the corresponding loss of revenue for the first quarter and beyond.

We continue to see pressure on service revenue from the costs of promotions and the amortization impact in the first quarter. Additionally, we see
pressure from prepaid revenue as a result of lower subscribers versus prior year. To help offset these pressures, we've recently implemented
additional pricing actions across our business and consumer segments. We expect to see the benefits of these actions ramp across the second
quarter as the business segment began billing customers closer to the end of the first quarter, while consumers started earlier this month.

As a result of these combined pricing actions, we anticipate approximately $75 million of incremental quarterly revenue moving forward. Additionally,
the consumer team is working to improve efficiencies around device promotions and credits that we expect to yield revenue benefits across the
remainder of the year. We believe that the actions the teams are taking will grow the top line, driving both EBITDA and cash flow. To complement
this, the team expects to make additional progress across 2023 on the development and implementation of cost efficiency initiatives, resulting in
a meaningful savings run rate at the end of the year.

During the first quarter, operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were down 2.4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost
of equipment from reduced upgrade volume which helped to offset an increase in bad debt of approximately $200 million. Similar to involuntary
churn rates, bad debt expense reflects the return of collections to pre-pandemic levels. While up year-over-year, bad debt expense is relatively
consistent with the prior quarter.

Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter totaled $8.3 billion compared to $6.8 billion in the prior year. This increase was primarily
due to working capital improvements driven by lower inventory levels, coupled with fewer upgrades and a modest improvement in customer
payment patterns despite the current macroeconomic conditions. CapEx for the quarter came in at $6.0 billion, which includes most of the remaining
$1.75 billion of C-band-related spending in our guidance.

With the conclusion of the program, we would expect a step down in the pacing of overall CapEx throughout the remainder of the year and continue
to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital
spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $2.3 billion up $1.3 billion versus last year. Total unsecured debt for the quarter was $132.0 billion, an
increase of $1.4 billion compared to the end of 2022 and $5.3 billion lower year-over-year. This resulted in net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA
ratio of 2.7x as of the end of the first quarter. A 0.1x improvement compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat from the prior quarter.

We continue to have very low near-term unsecured debt maturities with the only maturity remaining in 2023 being approximately $600 million
due in the second quarter. I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be my last earnings call as Verizon's CFO. It has been a fulfilling
10 years at Verizon and a privilege to serve as CFO, and I'm thankful to everyone that has made it such a rewarding experience.

From our talented finance team to my fellow executive team members to all of you that have had the pleasure of getting to know I want to say
thank you. Verizon is in good hands with Tony as its CFO. I've worked closely with him since my first day at the company, and I know he will always
strive to drive the business forward in a way that puts Verizon and its shareholders first. I truly look forward to seeing what he and the entire Verizon
team will achieve as I cheer them on from the sidelines as an enthusiastic customer and shareholder.

With that, I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to your questions.

APRIL 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Matt. In summary, our disciplined approach has led to significant progress on our key strategic plans and we need to keep the momentum
and focus going. We're pleased with how 2023 has started. We continue to deliver the best customer experience on the most reliable network
supported by the best people in the industry. In mobility, our segmented and surgical approach to the market is working, and we are taking pricing
actions where possible.

In broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning as we continue to capture market share. We'll continue to grow our
cash generation profile and maximize shareholder returns aided by our cost efficiency program and lowered capital expenditures. I remain confident
in our strategy and our strong focus on execution. We are always identifying new ways to evolve our business and execute on opportunities. In
everything we do, we focus on driving profitable growth. We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders for our ability to grow
service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow.

Brady, over for the questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions this morning.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) The first question for today comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Great. And Matt, thanks for all the help over the years and best of luck to you in the future. If I could just start with a couple of wireless questions.
First on the gross adds on the consumer side, obviously, some strength there. Any other detail you can give us in terms of what's driving the
double-digit improvement. I think AT&T saw a decline.

If there's just any change in the sort of promotional posture or anything you're doing there? And then on the other side of the ledger, churn,
obviously up a little bit year-over-year, but it sounds like you're making some trends. Did you guys make any pricing changes on the consumer
side in the first quarter? And just -- any comments around the sustainability of those improvements as we look forward throughout the year?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Matt. I think what we saw in the first quarter was very much the momentum. We start building
I would say, end of the third and into the fourth when it comes to both how we converted our customers to be part of our journey with the more
segmented approach. And that we have seen through the quarter when it comes to our gross adds that many of the initiatives we have had all the
way from the welcome plan and many of the others, they have been working well for us. So that's partly what we have been doing.

And then, of course, I think we're much more focused. And of course, now with the new team in place as well, where we have full alignment with
Sampath when it comes to the execution here and seeing that we're getting the right customers in. I think that has been helpful as well. Then as
you have seen, we're coming in and out of the quarter with promotions. We really are taking the opportunity when we see that we have an
opportunity to bring in customers. So that's how are you seeing the momentum continue. And as Matt said also in his opening here, we have seen
that momentum continuing for us.

And for the churn, I will hand it over to Matt. But as I said, I mean, we had a little bit higher in the beginning of the quarter and it continued to
improve. And we are working with both that as well as we continue to create the momentum we have right now on the consumer wireless. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Hans. So on the churn side, certainly, we saw improvement as the quarter went on. We had a little carryover from holiday level churn in
January by the time we got to March, we saw a much better momentum there. So that's the jump-off point as we go into second quarter. The
pricing changes that you mentioned in your question really didn't go into effect until we kind of came to the moving from Q1 to Q2 so that will be
incremental to the results of the business here as we get into the rest of the year.

So -- but as Hans said, really a case of rebuilding from the momentum last year that was a year ago was not where we wanted it to be. At the
midpoint of the year, we talked about taking actions, and you see the results of those actions showing up in the results. And so the team is focused
on continuing to build from there.

Operator

The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

I'd also like to reiterate my thanks to Matt for all his help over the years. My question is about fixed wireless. So when I look at the formal remarks
document you put out, it looks like you still have just over 40 million households where that can get your fixed wireless service. The reason I bring
it up is that would appear to be a fraction of the availability of your ultra-wideband network, which now covers over 2/3 of the population.

So I was wondering, how do we think about the game plan for expanding the distribution of the fixed wireless service now that you have significantly
expanded the ultra-broadband -- ultra-wideband network? And how do we think about the cadence of quarterly fixed wireless access here? Is
there still going to be a tailwind? Or are we getting to a point where it's leveling now?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brett. First of all, we're really pleased with the performance on the fixed wireless access. The team is doing a great work. And remember,
it's not only the consumer side, it's the business side as well on the business side. Many new use cases are coming up on using fixed wireless access.
So the team are scaling, and we're on scale right now. So like the rhythm I see on our sales promotions right now. And if you see in the first quarter,
almost 400,000.

When it comes to the network, you know that later -- the latter part of this year in December, actually -- or we will get our next chunk of C-band.
Right now, we're covering some 70 markets out of all 400. So it's 330 markets left, we will get the C-band. And we clearly pointed out in the opening
here that where we opened the C-band. We're not only seeing fixed-wire access opportunity. We also see step-ups and a greater upgrade cycle
for our customers because they see the improvements on the C-band. So we're very encouraged by the C-band coming out. But as I said, we're
waiting for the clearance by the year-end to get even more. But as we roll out right now, we open up markets.

And remember, we talked about that we are in the network team, we're now decentralizing so we can attack locally because we are sort of opening
markets locally. The same goes what Sampath is working on right now is also taking his operations more locally, so we can both the marketing and
execution locally. And you might have seen it that we do more local things because as we open up more on fixed wireless access. We do that locally.
And so far, our success rate is high. We're just going to go do this in the right way to take the learnings with us doing better all the time.

We also have started with differentiation on different type of peers when it comes to our fixed wireless offerings. There's a lot more to be done
there.

But as I said, I'm very pleased with the rhythm and the market share we're taking and remember, the C-band, so far is deployed mainly in urban
and suburban areas, the majority of the spectrum coming is actually in more of the suburban and rural. And we also get, of course, more urban
spectrum as we're only deploying 60, maybe 80-somewhat megahertz, 100 where we are, in average, 160. So I have to say this is one of the biggest
5G use cases we have right now, and we really seeing good traction. So that's how we're going forward.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Brett.

Operator

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Again, my best wishes to Matt for the future. Just following up on Brett's fixed wireless question. You talked about scaling. It looks like you're almost
hitting 2 million fixed wireless subscribers now. How is it working on the network capacity side of things? And what's your confidence in going to
continue to handle increasing usage from the customers as this continues to scale?

And then if we could just go back to the announcement, I think it was March 3 of the new appointments. You talked a little bit about Kyle and
Sampath. But what if we were inside Verizon, what are the big changes that have taken place over the past 7 weeks or so that are really changing
the trajectory, particularly of consumer.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Simon. On the capacity, we -- the guys is great. First of all, were used on an initial trends of spectrum that we're using, as I said, we were
fixed wireless access on the ultra-wideband. We have so much more capacity coming. On top of that, all the new features you have with advanced
5G carrier aggregation, we have new devices coming out that can handle different spectrum.

So there are so many more things I feel really confident that we will manage this capacity without any problems to the levels we have talked about
and way beyond that. Then, of course, as I talked with many of you guys, if it comes a moment that we have a community that have a lot of fixed
wireless access we will have over time, other opportunities of cell splitting, et cetera. We are not even close to that today.

So I feel really good about how the guys are managing the network and the opportunities we're building on our C-band here. As I said, on the 4G
fixed wireless access, they were more opportunistic and selling when we see that we have capacity, but not sort of where we see that we have that
full. We're not selling any more. But this expansion is right now on 5G Ultra Wideband.

When it comes to the new team, the big changes I've seen, first of all, the first big change is that these guys are operational day one. I mean both
Kyle and Sampath is straight into it. If you look at Sampath, he's very much focused both on the customer dimension and seeing that we were
improving the momentum we have right now on gross adds and churn and see that we actually improving through the year. But he also works
with our offerings and our operations, see that we're even stronger locally. Kyle, on the other hand, continuing the work of Sampath, great momentum
on Business Wireless as we continue this quarter private networks is really taking off.

And then on top of that, working with a wireline decline to see that we're taking out cost at the same time, managing our contracts and I don't
think there's no one better than Kyle. He knows the network that more than anybody else. So I think that's the main focus and they've been really
fast. And then, of course, the transitions between Tony and Matt is going extremely simple because these guys have worked together for 10 years.
Tony is already into all the operations, working very closely with the new leaders all the way from Joe, that's running networking Kyle and Sampath.
So I feel good. I feel really good and confident about it, and it's very clear that the priorities there. So maybe, Tony, you can say something about
your priorities.

Tony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Designate

Sure. Thanks, Hans and good morning, Simon. I'm excited to have the opportunity to succeed Matt as the CFO. In terms of my priorities, I have 3
of them. First, supporting our new leaders, Sampath, Kyle and Joe in executing their strategies. And that includes narrowing our focus with a very
strong emphasis on operational performance; second, ensuring that we deliver the 2023 financial guidance that we laid out in January and third,
ensuring that we continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy, the 4 capital allocation priorities that we shared with you last year, those
remain unchanged. So those are my 3 priorities right out of the gate. And as Hans mentioned, the transition has gone exceptionally well.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Great.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Simon.

Operator

The next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Two, if I can. First, can you expand on the bad debt and churn discussion and how that relates to the upgrades, which seem to be fading through
the quarter? And then second, if you can talk about prepaid. Are the losses mostly happening in SafeLink and what is happening in this and the
different brands and any conversion of prepaid to postpaid this quarter? And how would you report that if it was happening?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. That was a lot of questions in one. I will start on the high level here on the -- as we said earlier, the payment patterns are basically same as
pre-COVID. We have a high-quality customer base. We see this as a very healthy at the moment, all the way. I will ask Matt to expand on that because
looking backwards. And then when it comes to the question on prepaid, or value segment, yes, as we said in an opening here, I mean, the negative
number is, I would say, 100% coming from SafeLink, which is a government-subsidized brand.

But there are other puts and takes there as well. I think that the visible brand is doing well. We're just ramping up total wireless, which is an important
piece of it, not having all the things coming through there. So -- and then, of course, we have the network migration still happening. So it's
combination of a lot of things on the different brands. Our confidence is that we will improve that at the latter part of the year when some of these
things are moving out. So that's a general comment, maybe on the churn piece, Matt, if you say something.

APRIL 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Phil. So looking at the churn and the bad debt and to your question was more around the bad debt side. So certainly up a little bit
year-over-year, but more importantly, flat sequentially. And what you're really seeing is first quarter last year, we still had some impacts in there of
some of the COVID-related activities. That's now fully out.

And I'd say we're back to perpetual type run rate. In terms of the -- with the lower upgrades in there, also the plus 11% phone gross adds, as Hans
mentioned in his prepared remarks, a lot of those gross adds were new to Verizon. And those new to Verizon customers typically come in at a
different bad debt accrual rate than upgrades, which is existing customers that we know well and so that's the trade-off there.

The other thing I look at on the bad debt side. One, you see from our most recent ABS filings at our FICO scores across our base continues to be
very strong. We've talked for many years now about the quality of the Verizon postpaid base and you see that there. And then secondly, the payment
patterns we actually had from customers this quarter actually just slightly better sequentially in terms of the aging. So we're seeing good behavior,
good payment activity from our customer base, which is why you see the flat bad debt on a sequential basis now that we're fully through the COVID
period.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

If I can just follow up, was there any conversion from prepaid to postpaid? Or I may have missed it.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

A little bit, but nothing material, but that's obviously certainly something the team is very focused on going forward, having that opportunity in
there, got that's still ahead of them to be a much more meaningful contributor going forward.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Phil.

Operator

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

Thanks for all the help, Matt. I guess in the prepared remarks, Matt, I think you mentioned that there were going to be some cost efficiency benefits
in 2023. I was wondering if you could kind of -- in that $2 billion to $3 billion target, talk about the cadence of how you see that unfolding in maybe
the second half of this year and into the coming years?

And then the second question would be one of the things that's contributed to, I think, the momentum that you guys have been talking about a
lot on the call has been a combination of the new kind of more affordable welcome unlimited plan and a lot of the marketing you've been doing.
Could you talk about what the new kind of management team wants to do to take that maybe to another level, if at all, this year and kind of what
the end goal is flat subscribers the goal? Or is market share the goal? That would be helpful.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I will start, and then I will toss the question and toss to Tony, and I will start with your second question. So the team -- I think we just need to divide
the wireless question that you have. On the business side, I think it's clear, we're really strong. We are taking market share. The team is working
through SMB, government and large enterprises with our offerings where the network is the key contributor.

Kyle will continue that work and the drumbeat we have there. On the consumer side, I think that Sampath and I are 100% aligned that we are in a
momentum where we are now going to continue to improve our net additions on consumer, but most importantly is to grow in the service revenue
but of course, we want customers as well. But mostly important is growing the service revenue and expanding the cash flow and EBITDA. That's
really the main focus for Sampath that were 100% aligned on. But that also means that we need to take customers. And I think that we will continue
to evolve our proposition and coming with new products.

So I feel encouraged what I've seen so far and the thinking that Sampath and the team have, but we need to stay tuned for some of the new things
coming, Tony?

Tony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Designate

Thanks, Hans. David. So on the cost side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're making progress with Verizon Global Services and all the
cost transformation efforts. As we mentioned previously, we're on track with our cost efficiency program to take $2 billion to $3 billion of cost out
by 2025. Within that, we'll see some of those benefits manifest themselves in the second half of this year in '23 with significant savings in 2024 and
really focused on areas like sourcing, transformation, IT conversions and transformations as well as supply chain and other AI models.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Dave.

Operator

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Matt, I also want to express my thanks and best wishes as you leave Verizon. If I could focus on 2 topics. First, on the ARPU side, if you can unpack
a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing on the unlimited and premium unlimited take rates and where those can go over time in terms of
continuing to monetize the network and the bundles that you offer? And then on the lower upgrade rate, are you seeing a fundamental change
in customer holding periods for devices and what does that mean for the size of the switcher pool in the industry going forward?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can start. I mean, we -- I can on a high level, say we continue to see the trends from our customer on postpaid going to unlimited and then go to
unlimited premium. That continues, the team is doing great work to see that we're doing that transition. And -- but we still have opportunities. We
still have customer metered plans. We still have a portion on unlimited, it can go to unlimited premium.

So we still see that as an important growth trajectory for our ARPU going forward. And then on the upgrades, I mean, we have talked about before,
I mean the market indication is that it's going to be a little bit smaller switcher pool. That doesn't mean that we feel that we shouldn't be taking
more fair share. We should definitely do that and continue to see that our customers that we have, we're expanding with them, and then we're

actually bringing new customers. So I think -- that's what we see right now. But again, we have good momentum with all the offerings we have. I
expect my consumer team come out with new offerings as well. So -- and continue that drumbeat, Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, exactly, Hans. And Mike, so as you think about it, the strategy is 1 always to get the customer in, then have the opportunity to move
customers up the stack and you see we've done that number of different ways over the years, and you should expect us to continue to find ways
to do that.

And then also, we get the opportunity to add other things to the account, so fixed wireless access allows us to increase ARPA and adding other
devices to the accounts, too. So there's still significant opportunities there for us to grow share of wallet with the customer as we go forward. And
I would expect that the consumer team will continue to make sure that they are having the right pricing constructs and offerings in front of
customers, and those will constantly evolve over time so that we can continue to grow ARPA.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

And if I could just throw one other out there. Just from a government program perspective, can you share how Verizon participates in ACP? And
any new thoughts on potentially participating in the BEAD program?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I'll take the first shot. Look, ACP is an important program. As you've seen, the actions we've taken over the past few years, whether it's the
acquisition of Tracfone, the introduction of plans like Welcome. We want to participate in all customer segments. That includes ACP, whether that
be on the wireless side or the fixed side. So we do participate in those programs. And then as the BEAD programs come out, we will look for where
it makes the most sense for us to participate in those programs. We've been doing -- we've been building fiber out to our homes for a long time.
We continue to do so.

Over 500,000 new OFS last year, we said we'd do something in that same region again this year and into the foreseeable future at that type of run
rate. So as that those new programs help us the opportunities to continue to do that will certainly be very interested in looking at using them
where it makes sense.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Great. Thanks, Mike.

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst

I want to sort of step back to a more strategic question about the wireless business, if I could. I mean for years, your business model and your --
and sort of the way you came to market was based on a very low churn strategy, therefore, arguably, you didn't need the same number of gross
adds to sustain growth. And it was based on a very clear value proposition of Best Network.

APRIL 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q1 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

It seems like all of those pieces are quite different now. And despite what you said about the prospects for churn, churn is quite a bit higher for
retention. How do you kind of win the battle for the hearts and minds, particularly in the consumer segment by sort of returning to the base of
convincing customers that yours is really the best network and sort of how do you win with the value proposition?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I will start here. First of all, what we see right now is we have a clear value proposition when we roll out the C-band. We have great uptake, step-ups
from our customers when they see the C-band. And you know better than anybody else how much of that spectrum we have right now, which is
a very little bit. And with all that, we get this momentum, that's why I feel so good about it.

And then as Matt said, our churn a little bit elevated, but it's also improving in the quarter. So we're working on that. And having a gross -- the gross
adds momentum at the same time. That tells you something about where we're going right now heading. And then we have Sampath in the role
that really no operational execution. So I think we have all that and we have the best network clearly, and it's just going to get better. I mean with
every measurement we do right now, we are clearly come out as #1.

And the only thing I know for sure. We're going to extend that leadership with the C-band continue to roll out. So our proposition is very clear,
continue to have the best network, have a good proposition for our customer because you need to continue to do new offerings to the consumer
group because their behaviors are changing as well. That's why we came with it, +play. We're listening to customers to make it easier and all of
that. And you haven't seen the loss from us. So I think that we're building on all the strength we have and those strengths are even getting stronger.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Craig.

The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

Can you be a little clearer on the network upgrades -- it looks like you're more than doubling the amount of spectrum by year-end. What does that
mean for coverage, do you think, and capacity? And when will we get to 300 million homes passed and more like 70 million or 80 million that have
the ability to get fixed wireless?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So on the network, you're absolutely right. We have just -- on the C-band we have just started to roll it out in the majority of the 60, 70 markets
we're rolling out right now, we're using 60 megahertz. And you know we have an average 160 megahertz and in many places, even up to 200
megahertz. So it's an enormous difference when it comes from 60 to 160 megahertz, how much more capacity there is and on top of that, of course,
we are adding new type of software features like carrier aggregation, the chip sets is getting better in devices, both the handset and the fixed
wireless access devices.

So that's going to enhance the capacity for us. And as I said, we were very focused to see that we materialize our business cases for the C-band, all
the way from consumer and business wireless to fixed wire access and mobile edge compute and private networks. So we focus on the revenue
generation of it, and we'll continue to do so. But clearly, it's going to be a step-up when we get the next tranche. And we're going to open more
homes or households penetrated with fixed wireless access, and we're going to have much more markets covered by the C-band. So we're just
going to continue that journey as fast as we can.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

But does the increase section help the coverage? Or do you still have to build out in those areas?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I would say, as we said from the beginning, which many people doubted we can use our existing 4G grid for the C-band. There is -- we don't need
any new. However, we always build some new sites. We find new areas where there have been capacity constraints.

We'll continue to do that as well. But mainly our C-band is using the 4G grid in order to see that the coverage is coming out there. And this year,
we're going to build a little bit more sites than we've normally done and the -- and our 4G spectrum AWS and et cetera, is covering 300 million
POPs a day. And that's where we'll build our C-band right now.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Great, Tim.

The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.

Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst

Thank you. Hans, strategically, you face a few choices, which I think are contradictory in some way, and there is an attempt to grow gross adds,
obviously, but SG&A is growing faster than revenues, and so that puts pressure on margins. And it also comes with cash flow trade-offs. And you
are trying to increase price to offset this margin impact, but that comes with churn trade-offs.

So ultimately, when you think about your growth model or the growth algorithms what's the north star? Is it unit growth? And are you willing to
sacrifice margins and cash flow to get to that turnaround point? Or is it margins? Even if it comes at the expense of unit growth because it does
feel like there is a choice that has to be made at some point. And I'm just wondering what the metric is that you're most focused on?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I think it's crystal clear. Our metrics that we're measured on is the service revenue and the EBITDA and cash flow expansion. You still need to have
customers for that, and you need to grow that. But ultimately, that's what we measure ourselves on to see that we can grow that. And that's what
you have seen from us right now. And you see the cash flow in the quarter. We are very focused on that. We think that's very important for all the
stakeholders. And so then, of course, units are important, but it's even more important to see that we have the right growth metrics when it comes
to the company's finance. But maybe Tony wants to add something here.

Tony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Designate

To just add on to what Hans mentioned. I mean we have to be disciplined and segmented in how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes
that drive profitable revenue growth. So the team is laser focused on that.

The next question is from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research.

Peter Supino - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior Analyst

Question back to fixed wireless. Obviously, the expansion to suburban and rural markets is a big opportunity back in the urban areas where your
C-band depth is going to more than double in 2023. Is there any reason that expansion shouldn't support accelerated marketing and approval of
inbounds about FWA so that you would drive up your net adds in those markets as well?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

That's clear. I mean, and that's why our organization, both on the consumer side and the business side and our network side, it's more regional
right now because we're following the sort of the deployment of the network and doing marketing and outreach to our customers on fixed wireless
access that really want to have it when we open up. So clearly, you're right, there is also opportunity in the urban places where we get more capacity
or more coverage and as it goes for the suburban and the rural.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Great. Thanks, Peter. Brad, we have time for one more question.

Operator

Your last question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.

Frank Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research

Can you -- with the business changes, can you walk us through on the SaaS line? What is sort of SaaS revenue in total and where can you see growth
there? And then back to the phone adds with the new level of gross adds you're getting, are there any characteristics about this type of customer
you're tracking now that might be different than, say, 2 years ago and what their long-term churn characteristics might be?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So you need to repeat the first question. You're talking about SaaS revenues?

Frank Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research

Well, with the breakout -- new breakout on the business line item. Just curious how much of that line that includes SaaS. Is SaaS revenue and what
is that growing?

Tony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Designate

Yes. We don't disclose the SaaS revenue specifically, so.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. But overall, I mean, it's not the largest part of that customer group, you should be a fair assumption from.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Okay. And then what was the second part of the question, Frank?

Frank Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research

So with the gross adds that you're getting, are there any characteristics about these customers you're tracking today that are maybe different from
what they were, say, 2 years ago. And I'm curious about what you think about the long-term churn characteristics of customers you're tracking
today, particularly given the heavier promotional activity that you've done versus what you did historically?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

In general, I think the churn characteristics, all the new customers coming in is even better than before for many reasons, as you said yourself. And
then the type of customers, I think Matt talked a little bit on the type of gross adds we're getting is new customers to Verizon, where they come in.
And of course, we have opportunities to upgrade and step up them and also having opportunities for our converged offerings. So really good
quality of the customers coming in, as Matt said as well. So we feel really good about the growth momentum we have and the customers we are
getting.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Frank. Brad, that's all the time we have today.

e have spoken to you before about our three-tier strategy. First, sustaining quality and performance leadership in all of our networks; 
second, in building new ecosystems around our broadband, video, and Internet of Things global platforms; and finally, monetizing our 
investments in networks and platforms through applications and content. I am very pleased with the progress that we are making 
across all of these fronts. 

 W

n addition, yesterday we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Yahoo's operating business for 
approximately $4.8 billion, a transaction that will make us an even stronger competitor in digital media. With everything that's going on, I 
wanted to take a few minutes at the start of this call to put these initiatives in context and tell you how we are strengthening our ability to 
realize our mission of delivering the promise of the digital world. 

 I

e continued to evolve our Wireless pricing model and customer interface. We closed the Frontier transaction. We made major moves 
in our network and reached new contracts with our labor unions, all while delivering solid results in a challenging environment. We will 
discuss all of these in more detail in a few minutes. 

 W

Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an eventful first half of 2016 marked with 
several strategic milestones. 

Before Lowell and Fran go through our strategy and these results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2016, 
we reported earnings of $0.17 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results included several significant non-operational items 
that I would like to highlight. 

ur reported earnings include a non-cash pretax loss of $3.6 billion generated by pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily 
due to the remeasurements triggered by the new labor contracts, the transaction with Frontier, and settlement accounting. The overall 
impact after tax amounted to $2.2 billion, or $0.54 per share. 

 O

e incurred non-operational expenses of $1.8 billion in connection with the early debt redemption and tender offers. On an after-tax 
basis, these charges amounted to $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $1 billion on the sale of 
California, Florida, and Texas wireline markets to Frontier. On an after-tax basis, the gain on sale amounted to $139 million, or $0.03 
per share. 

 W

n the balance sheet side in the quarter, employee benefit obligations were reduced on a net basis by $1.6 billion, primarily driven by 
actuarial valuations associated with the new labor contracts and the Frontier transaction, which were partially offset by the mark-to-
market remeasurements and the assets transferred to Frontier. Year to date, unfunded employee benefit obligations have been 
reduced by $1.9 billion. 

 O

xcluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.94 in the second quarter compared with $1.04 

 E

ur adjusted results include the impact of the work stoppage, which at the consolidated level amounted to $420 million on a pretax 
basis, representing about $0.07 per share. At the Wireline segment level, before consolidating intercompany transactions, the pretax 
amount was $489 million. As previously stated, we will not recapture the $0.07 for the impact of the work stoppage on full-year 2016 
earnings per share. 

 O

per share a year ago, or a decline of 9.6%. There were no special items of a non-operational nature in the second quarter of 2015. 

or purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the operations that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016, 
have been reclassified to Corporate and Other. On June 28, we filed a Form 8-K providing the recast unaudited historical information 
for the past nine quarters, which can be accessed on our website. Additionally, prior-period results do not include the operations of 
AOL.

n the second quarter alone, network usage increased 44% over the prior year. To give you a perspective on traffic growth, we carry the 
same amount of traffic on our network in one hour today as we did 10-plus years ago in one week. 

 I

For us, delivering the promise of the digital world begins with network leadership, which has been the cornerstone of our brand since 
we formed Verizon in 2000. Our 4G LTE network consistently leads all external studies for quality and reliability across the country, 
even with the explosive growth of data usage. Over the last 16 years, we have grown from approximately 25 million customers using 
wireless almost exclusively for voice services to more than 110 million customers using wireless for mostly data services. 

 know we heard a lot of skepticism when we formed the 5G Tech Forum last fall, with critics questioning the need for moving so soon. 
But as we learned from our experience with 4G, being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the 
best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities. 

 I

o longer are discussions solely about local franchise rights, but how to make forward-looking cities more productive and effective. Our 
announced agreement to acquire XO Communications will also be a key part of this strategy, providing us with the deep fiber assets 
including 40 metro fiber rings in major cities and millimeter wave spectrum in a significant part of the country that will give us a critical 
competitive edge. 

 N

he balance has shifted away from building capacity exclusively through spectrum. We believe that 4G will be the base layer of our 
Wireless network for years to come. Moreover, our approach to network architecture is also preparing us for 5G and shaping our 
thinking about future investment that will drive growth across all our business and ecosystem. 

 T

virtualization initiatives, which provide operating, capital, and spectral network efficiencies. 

e are also optimizing 4G with new techniques like centralized baseband architecture, carrier aggregation, and core network 

 W

ou saw the first fruits of this strategy in April, when we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We will create a single 
fiber-optic network platform capable of supporting wireless and wireline technologies and multiple products. In particular, we believe the 
fiber deployment will create economic growth for Boston and we are talking to other cities about similar partnerships. 

 Y

esterday the FCC approved our lease arrangement with XO so that we have a clear spectrum path toward 5G deployment, which, like 
4G, will be a game changer. I think of 5G initially as, in effect, wireless fiber, which is wireless technology that can provide an enhanced 
broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With wireless fiber, the so-called last 
mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure. 

 Y

erizon has been a leader in pushing the industry forward in every new generation of wireless technology. With 3G, we ushered in an 
era of wireless data. By being the first to implement 4G LTE, we changed the game for the delivery of wireless broadband, opening up 
new opportunities for our customers and the industry as a whole. 

 V

TE is a growth engine for applications and devices across the ecosystem, increasing the productivity of our country. New players are 
entering this ecosystem every day. To make sure 4G LTE can handle our customers' ever-increasing demands, we are challenging 
conventional approaches to network architecture by deploying fiber to cell sites and densifying cells to handle the constant demand on 
the network in high-usage areas. 

 L

n light of this growing demand, we are continuing to invest in and evolve our Wireless network to provide the broadest, most reliable, 
and highest quality wireless experience for our customers. This investment includes expanding the fiber front and backhaul to support 
wireless network growth. 

 I

obile use cases, which will follow toward the end of the decade, will include massive Internet of Things scale and low latency services 
and applications. Trade associations are already accelerating their timelines for standards, which will be good for the industry. The 

 M

n our labs we are able to predict and model what a future home will look like with multiple high-definition TVs, laptops, tablets, and 
virtual reality applications served over a wireless connection, delivered at speeds significantly higher than 1 gigabit per second. We are 
conducting field trials to see how the technology will perform using millimeter wave spectrum in terms of reach and propagation in real-
world conditions.

hrough every generation of technology, our fundamental principles remain the same, highest quality, consistent investment, customer 
value, and, yes, superior execution. This dedication to network quality has created the best wireless network in the world. Maintaining 
and extending that leadership remains the number one priority of the Company. 

 T

o we see the stars aligning very quickly when it comes to the 5G future. We have been very pleased by the partnership with the FCC 
to finalize the 5G spectrum rules. All of this keeps us on track to be the first carrier to deploy a 5G network in the United States, 
preparing us for a fixed commercial wireless fiber launch in 2017 and laying the foundation to build mobility use cases later in the 
decade. 

 S

o date, we have accomplished several key milestones in moving toward 5G. Along with our Tech Forum partners, we completed radio 
specifications, which means that we can now test technical components for wireless fiber services. We have ongoing technical trials in 
several markets to accelerate the pace of innovation, and we are strengthening our partnerships with carriers and OEMs to foster the 
development of a global ecosystem. 

 T

ecosystem, including chipset equipment and device manufacturers, is aggressively adding resources to deliver handsets and low-
latency applications. 

ver the past several years we have dramatically expanded the ways in which we can deliver content wherever and however the digital 
customer wants it, including large and small bundles of linear content through FiOS TV; new and better customer experiences for FiOS 
using IP-based technology; over-the-top delivery of content; purchasing of AOL, with its publishing and advertising technology and 
content; further enhancing AOL with the Millennial Media acquisition; introducing go90 and its vast library of digital content, not only for 
our Verizon customers, but other carriers' customers as well; developing a global video distribution for media companies to efficiently 
deliver high-quality digital content; and finally, establishing a content joint venture with Hearst through which we have invested in two 
leading digital brands for female and male Millennials, namely AwesomenessTV and Complex Media. 

 O

e assembled a great team and strong assets under Marni Walden. Just over the past year since the AOL acquisition, we have 
learned a tremendous amount about the video market and opportunities to grow in the future. Her team is focused on integrating these 
assets and driving profitable growth by attracting viewers through great content, which, in turn, attracts advertisers by increasing the 
return on their advertising dollar. 

 W

ith the other two tiers of our three-part strategy, we are developing the platforms, content, and applications that will drive usage on 
our network and monetize our investment in this world class infrastructure. Let me review our progress in these areas starting with 
video. 

 W

s you know, we've been building our video assets and capabilities for some time with a goal of building a global platform and 
developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. At the heart of this video evolution are the changing ways in 
which younger consumers access their digital and mobile content. 

 A

 would like to thank our management employees for stepping in and serving our customers day in and day out during the strike. We are 
proud that our customer satisfaction results remained strong during this time, which demonstrates not only our planning, but our 
commitment to placing customers first in our business. 

 I

 would also like to thank the vast majority of our associates for the respectful way in which they conducted themselves during the work 
stoppage. We look forward to continuing to work with our represented employees to better serve our customers and create work 
environments that will allow all of our employees to grow professionally. 

 I

he contract benefits include workforce flexibility provisions that provide the opportunity to optimize processes and scale customer 
service center to better align with the business needs. Also, non-cash benefit savings primarily related to retiree healthcare will be 
realized. We preserved the bargained-for caps on our annual obligation for post-retirement medical benefits, which, when netted with 
other post-retirement benefit changes, reduced our unfunded employee benefit obligation by $4.7 billion in the quarter.

slide 5. 

o as I look at the first half of 2016, I am pleased with what we have accomplished in a fast-moving challenging environment and how 

 S

e are also building our growth capabilities in the emerging Internet of Things market by developing business models to monetize 
usage on our network at the connectivity and platform layers. We had another quarter of 25% growth in revenue from the Internet of 
Things, which amounted to approximately $205 million in the quarter and about $400 million year-to-date in 2016. We've also seen 
strong demand for our telematics products, including our direct-to-consumer product, hum, and see many opportunities to expand in the 
market. 

 W

We look forward to working with a very talented team at Yahoo. In the months ahead we will be focused on completing the necessary 
regulatory process, planning for integration, and closing this cash transaction early next year. Going forward, this acquisition will put us 
in a great position as a top global media company and give us a significant source of revenue growth for the future. 

n Wireless, we've made significant progress in shifting away from the subsidy model with 53% of our postpaid phone base now on 
unsubsidized price plans. At the same time, our churn metrics continue to be the best in the industry, which is a testimony to our high-
quality loyal customer base. Fran is going to cover more of that in a few minutes. 

 I

n June we agreed to acquire Telogis, which will advance our fleet telematics connected solutions and expand our distribution 
relationships while we grow our global scale. So as we are making tremendous strides strategically, John Stratton and his operations 
team are not taking their eye off the ball when it comes to operational performance. I am pleased with where we stand as we reach the 
midpoint of the year. 

 I

n Wireline, we completed the sale of three properties to Frontier, which concentrates our Wireline assets in the Northeast corridor, 
where we can further invest in fiber. We also managed through a seven-week work stoppage, ultimately reaching an outcome that 
benefited our employees and our business. While the strike impacted the results in the second quarter, the new labor contracts will 
generate approximately $500 million of cash savings over the term of the contract.

Fran Shammo  - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO  

Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis, total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we 
exclude the second-quarter 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, which 
was not part of our operations a year ago, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 3.5% on a comparable year-
over-year basis.

ash flows from operations were $5.4 billion in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, cash flows from operations totaled 
$12.8 billion, which is down $6.1 billion on a year-over-year basis, driven by the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion 
in the first quarter of 2015, a change in our method of monetizing device payment receivables, and an increase in cash taxes. 

 C

ree cash flow for the first half of the year totaled $5.6 billion. Subsequent to the quarter, we completed our first on-balance-sheet 
asset-backed securitization transaction with net proceeds of $1.1 billion for which there was significant investor demand. Going forward, 
we expect to finance new device payment plan receivable originations with on-balance-sheet securitizations with a mix of bank 
transactions or public transactions. 

 F

securitization transaction the third quarter. This timing resulted in approximately $1.6 billion of working capital pressure. 

ublic or 144a on-balance-sheet securitizations as a funding channel provides several benefits, including diversification and lower 
borrowing costs with AAA rating. Favorable captive finance treatment from two credit rating agencies is an offset to the financial 
statement impacts of on-balance-sheet financing. The financial statements will reflect an increase in receivables as new loans are 
originated and debt will also reflect new securitization financing. 

 P

ash taxes are higher compared to a year ago as certain benefits that we realized in the prior period did not recur and timing of tax 
deductions for early debt retirements varied. Cash taxes will increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to the taxes that will 
be paid related to the sale of our Wireline operations which are approximately $3.2 billion. 

 C

e ended the quarter with $99.7 billion of total debt, net debt of $96.9 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2 times, 
which includes the liability management that we did in the quarter. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile 
by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. 

 W

ur disciplined capital allocation model demonstrates our commitment to investing in businesses for the future. Capital expenditures 
were $3.9 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion for the first half of the year. While the first-half trend is lower than expected due to timing 
and the strike impact in Wireline, we reiterate our full-year capital guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. 

 O

ow let's move into reviews of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide 7. 

 N

oing forward, the cash flow statement will reflect securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. As a 
result, using on-balance-sheet financing will result in lower cash flows from operations and, therefore, lower free cash flow, but will not 
reduce the cash we have available to run the business as we plan to continue to securitize a significant amount of our receivables 
portfolio. We will provide additional disclosures on securitization in the third quarter.

otal Wireless operating revenues declined 4% in the quarter to $21.7 billion. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.4% for the 
quarter, an improvement from the year-over-year decline of 6.2% in the first quarter. Equipment revenue was $3.7 billion, down 4.1% 
due to lower activations. 

 T

ervice revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.1 billion in the second quarter. While service revenue will continue to be 
pressured by the migration of our customer base to the unsubsidized price plans, the decline has flattened as expected now that we 
have approximately 53% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. 

 S

et's turn now to cash flows on the balance sheet on slide 6. 

 L

AOL, once again, delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter. In Wireless, service revenue, as expected, was pressured by the 
migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans. Equipment revenue was also under pressure, due primarily to 
lower postpaid phone activations. 

onsolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled about $11.1 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% in the quarter, compared to 
$11.8 billion a year ago. As Lowell just reviewed, we are reducing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining 
efficiency in our operations throughout the business, which will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.

ostpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, down from 3.9 million a year ago and flat sequentially. Retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, up 4 
basis points from the prior year. We continue to see strong retention in our phone base, which is being offset by increasing tablet churn 
stemming from the free tablet promotions from two years ago. We expect the higher rates of tablet churn to continue throughout the 
entire year. 

 P

ostpaid net adds, which does not include any wholesale connections including Internet of Things, totaled 615,000. Overall, postpaid 
net additions declined sequentially, primarily due to increased tablet churn. Net phone additions increased sequentially to 86,000. We 
added 462,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were offset by a net decline of 250,000 basic phones. The remaining offset 
in phone net adds were 3G devices. 

 P

ablet net adds totaled 356,000. All other postpaid devices totaling 173,000 were added during the quarter with Verizon Wireless retail 
hum devices being the primary driver. Net prepaid devices declined by 30,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement 
sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact new pricing plans for our prepaid market. 

 T

e ended the quarter with 113.2 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid 
connections base grew 3.9% to 107.8 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Let's now take a look at 4G device 
activations and upgrades on slide 9. 

 W

otal postpaid device activations were 9.5 million in the quarter, down 4.3% sequentially and nearly 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. 
Approximately 81% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. About 
5.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. This represents a decline of 180 basis points. 

 T

he growth in FiOS is driven by a higher customer base and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 11% of our FiOS 
Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see the downsizing of our video bundles and increased 
appetite for our custom TV package, which represented nearly 40% of FiOS video sales in the quarter. 

 T

onsumer revenue declined 0.3% and mass markets, which include small business, declined 1.2% on a comparable basis, excluding 
the property sold to Frontier. FiOS total revenue grew 3.7%. FiOS revenue was strong, even with the work stoppage and a high prior-
year comparable pay-per-view fight event. 

 C

et's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide 10. 

 L

iOS subscriber growth was impacted by the work stoppage in the second quarter. We made significant progress on working through 

 F

the backlog of new installations in June and expect to return to a normal run rate in the third quarter. 

ow let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on slide 8. 

 N

n terms of profitability, we generated $10.3 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 3.8%, and had a segment EBITDA 
margin of 47.5%, up from 43.9% a year ago. 

 I

he percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 67% in the second quarter, compared with about 68% in the 
first quarter. The take rate, which was lower than our expectations, was due primarily to a higher mix of business customers in our 
overall postpaid phone activations for the quarter. 

 T

We recently refreshed the Verizon plans to enable increased customer control. We believe the pricing plans are resonating with our 
customers, providing value and functionality. As with any new pricing plan, we expect some account optimization early on and we 
remain confident that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the fourth quarter of 2017. 

e expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. We recognize that new 

 W

device launches could have an impact on take-rate levels, but at this point it is too early to forecast any changes. 

uring the quarter, 5.2 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we have about 31.8 million phone connections 

 D

activated on a device payment plan, representing about 37% of our postpaid phone base.

otal operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.4% in the second quarter, due to technology transitions and pricing 
pressures. In the second quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.3% and, on a constant currency basis, the decline was about the 
same. 

 T

In FiOS video, net customers declined 41,000 of the quarter. FiOS Internet net adds were negative 13,000 and net broadband 
subscribers decreased by 83,000. FiOS video penetration was 34.6% in the quarter, compared to 35.5% in the prior year, representing 
a decline of 90 basis points. FiOS Internet penetration was 40.1% in the quarter compared to 39.8% in the prior year, representing an 
increase of 30 basis points. We believe we have an opportunity to further penetrate the markets we serve. 

et's turn to slide 11 and cover Enterprise and Wholesale, as well as the Wireline segment in total. 

 L

ireline capitalized labor expenditures slowed in the second quarter as we prioritized maintenance and repair activities over new 
installations during the work stoppage. We expect capital spending levels to increase in the second half of the year as we return to 
normal operations after the work stoppage. 

 W

ireline segment EBITDA margin the quarter was 14%, which includes the impact of work stoppage compared to 18.7% in the prior 
year. The pre-tax financial impact of the strike in the quarter was $489 million on the Wireline segment. In terms of improving the overall 
margin, we made improvements in cost structure by optimizing our workforce and expect benefits from the new labor contracts to be 
realized during the remainder of 2016 and in future years. 

 W

n our global Wholesale business, revenues declined 4.1% in the second quarter. Trends in our Enterprise global Wholesale 
businesses remain consistent with prior periods. 

 I

s expected, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We are focused on executing operationally, strategically, and financially 
to deliver results today and prepare the business for future profitable growth. In the first half of the year in Wireless, we added 1.3 
million postpaid net customers and stabilized our Wireless service revenue declines. In Wireline, we completed the sale of the 
operations in California, Florida, and Texas and negotiated new labor contracts which will have benefits into the future. We continue to 
be the network leader in the markets we serve and we are setting the business up for growth. 

 A

n our new businesses, we enhanced our video and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are 
demonstrating progress. We are very excited about the work that has already been done, the integration of assets that we are 
beginning to do, and the acquisition of Yahoo to accelerate our video platforms. 

 I

s we enter the second half of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute and drive results. We are on course for our 2016 
guidance and expectations: full-year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work 
stoppage; consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full-year 2015; consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion 
and $17.7 billion; a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million; and our effective tax rate for financial 
reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%. We also expect GDP-type growth in consolidated revenue for the full-year 2017. 

 A

ith that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions. 

 W

et's move next to our summary slide.

Thank you, Fran. Tori, we are now ready to take questions. 
 QUESTION AND ANSWER 

(Operator Instructions) John Hodulik, UBS. 

perator  

  O

 
 
   
 
  
  
  
n the "do we have the assets we need," certainly yesterday when Marni and Tim did their public interviews; we are extremely excited 
about the assets that Yahoo has in the areas of sports and finance and email and news. You match those up with AOL; we've just 
made an exponential leap in capabilities here. 

 O

those numbers. But they are meaningful, let me just put it that way. 

ut I will give you the answer that I always give you, John, when we talk about capital and you say, well, are you finally done expanding 
and are you going to reduce your capital? And my answer always is, I hope not, because if we do then we are standing still and this is 
such a dynamic environment, we should be looking for additional things to meet customers' needs. 

 B

o I think as we get closer to closing, which we expect will be either at the end of the year or early in the first quarter, we will announce 

 S

o we have a good idea and we've heard numbers bantered around that are in the ballpark, but my view on this, John, is we now enter 
a phase where, post the auction diligence, which is certainly limited, we can go in and talk to management and see a much greater 
depth of information. And we will validate our plans and make our decisions. 

 S

I think probably we were the only significant bidder that had synergies. 

Good morning, John, and good morning, everyone. I understand there were lots of rumors about me announcing a big reorganization 
of the Company, so I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I think we have some pretty exciting things to talk about here. 

irst, on Yahoo synergy. Look, certainly, as we went into the auction process, we had a very good idea of what the synergies could be. 

 F

e're a small player today relative to them. All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market and this will 

 W

be a success for us, and we certainly expect to do better than that. 

significant player here. The market is going to grow dramatically. 

o there's been a lot made of are we going to challenge Google and Facebook in this process. I just say, look, we plan on being a 

 S

 fully expect that when Tim and Marissa put their heads together, we will have a long list. And we will be disciplined, as we always are, 
and they will be good investments that will drive us to take a larger share of this growing market. 

 I

Lowell McAdam  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO  

owell, first of all, could you give us an early look at the synergies that you see coming with the Yahoo transaction? And with it behind

you now, do you feel that you have the assets you need to execute on the new media strategy? Thanks.

Thanks very much, good morning. Fran, I think you were one of the early ones to talk about elongating handset cycles. I think what 
we've seen so far with three companies reporting is very low upgrade rates, relatively low switching, but also low adds, low churn. 

 
 
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
nfortunately for us, though, we have our first set of EIP customers coming up on their two-year anniversary and there's not enough 
volume yet of those customers to really get a behavior track, if you will, whether they are going to hold their phone and take a $20 to 
$25 discount on their bill or if they are just waiting for a new phone. So I think it's too early to tell. We will have a better feel for this as 
we go into the third quarter and that's why in my prepared remarks I said it's too early to re-forecast. But as I have said consistently, I 
think our volumes will be similar to 2015. 

 U

Great, thanks, Simon. On handset cycles, so two viewpoints here. One is obviously we saw a similar trend, maybe not this dramatic, in 
2014 where we saw a slowdown in the first half of the year in anticipation of iconic phones that were coming up on a two-year cycle. So 
I think some of it could be that. 

s far as how do we stimulate smartphone growth, look, I've been saying for over a year now that smartphone growth is going to 
continue to slow and we have to look at other areas for that growth. Obviously tablets being one and we have a little bit of a headwind 
there. But if you look at the gross adds of tablets, we added over 1 million tablets this quarter, so we are having pressure in the churn 
metric for that free tablet promotion that we did two years ago and we will continue to have that pressure throughout the rest of the 
year. 

 A

ut if you look at the momentum of hum and you look at the other ads that we did, these are the types of devices that we want to add to 
the account to increase our revenue overall. If you look at the underlying I-ARPA, which is the installment and revenue per unit, that 
increased to 2.6% this quarter, so you can see the underlying revenue of our base is actually increasing. Unfortunately, you are not 
seeing it in the results because the math of moving from the subsidized to the unsubsidized is declining that. 

 B

he last comment I will make here on this topic is service revenue. You saw the 80 basis point improvement on service revenue, and as 
we have continued to say, once we crossed over that 50% mark -- and now we're at 53% of the base on the unsubsidized pricing -- we 
are starting to see that service revenue math take effect and that decline starting to reverse. 

 T

o 80 basis points this quarter; I continue to see that through the rest of the year we will improve. I will say that there won't be as much 
of an improvement in third quarter because of the new pricing and some of the optimization, but we will see improvement. And I 
continue to see this trend going through the end of 2017, which I'm still confident that we will show accretion at the end of 2017. 

 S

inally, on the data center sales, we are coming to an end of the process and we will probably come to a definitive answer in the third 

 F

quarter as to whether we're going to move forward or we are not. So I will hold comment for the third quarter for that. 

Fran Shammo  - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO  

To what extent do you think this is typical pre-iPhone lull or do you think we are in a new environment of more subdued activity going 
forward? In particular, as you think about your growth, you talked about the ARPU stabilizing and service revenues returning, but you 
also need stronger volume growth. What can you do to stimulate more of the phone adds as we go forward here? Thanks. 

nd anything you can say on the data center sale as well would be appreciated.

If I could follow up on Yahoo for a moment, in a letter that was picked up by the press from Yahoo's CEO yesterday, it referred to 
Verizon's goal to get to a global audience of 2 billion users and $20 billion of revenue within the mobile media business by 2020.

irst, in the sports area. As you know, we've got relationships with a lot of the big leagues; certainly NFL and NBA are the headliners for 
us. I've spoken with both Roger Goodell and Adam Silver in the last few weeks about this and I think we are very excited. And I expect 
over the next few months you will see more details about the plan of what we can do with their content, not only in season but out of 
season. 

 F

ike, I think this is similar to my answer to John's question. We've got a perspective going into this and we will refine it as we go along. 
But if you take a look at the interest that we have received from AOL current partners as well as new partners, we think there is a huge 
opportunity in the following areas. 

 M

Let me take the strategic question and then Fran can talk a little bit more about the profit side. 

nd there are other sports leagues that we have the opportunity to work with. Some of the other big names I'm not going to tip our hand 

 A

he next one is Yahoo Finance; that's probably their strongest asset today. We learn more about that. But as you look at, again, some 
of the networks that have finance channels and, frankly, some of the other folks that were bidding on this, we think there is an 
opportunity for us to work with them in partnership to realize some of their visions and some of our visions. 

 T

hey may already have NBA rights or NFL rights and we can work on streaming their games, not only through the traditional channels 
of FiOS, either custom TV or the full bundles, but over AOL and Yahoo and then finally over go90. So we view this as a waterfall of 
content moving down through our different properties. 

 T

here just yet, but the networks and their sports channels see an opportunity to partner with us. 

o I think on the profitability side, Fran, I don't know any comments you have on that. But that's where we are headed from a strategic 

 S

o I think the difference for us is we have a lot of -- us versus the Yahoo management, we have a lot of the relationships well 
established because of our FiOS and our mobile assets. And we can combine them with their platforms and their leadership expertise 
to deliver a very good lineup here. 

 S

their assets -- the TechCrunch, the Engadget, The Huffington Post -- and we can drive a lot of visits to the site. 

hen certainly news, as you would expect, and the email platforms. We see ways that we can combine some of our assets and some of 

 T

Lowell McAdam  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO  

I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that goal in a couple of respects in terms of what are the key strategies to get that 
growth. Is it simply just leveraging the assets you have or --? Can you give us a little more color on how you look to maybe manage 
them differently than they've been managed in the past?

perspective, Mike. 

Fran Shammo  - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO  

o the first thing here is to scale to drive that top-line growth. We believe that with the combination of all these assets we have a lot of 
revenue synergy upside, so the first will be to drive the top line and then, as Tim has shown, along with Yahoo team, we will drive the 
profitability that's required to generate the cash flow that we forecast. So that the top priority right now. 

 S

Mike, what I would say is everything that Lowell said and we're looking at this as a portfolio of assets. As I said during this whole 
process, look, Yahoo brings viewers; viewers brings advertising; advertising brings top-line growth.

t the Super Bowl last year, we went in and built out San Francisco and proved that thesis was correct. We were actually more 

 A

hen, as we densify the network for 4G, it sets us up perfectly for deploying 5G with the millimeter wave technology. So we are 
extremely pleased that the FCC approved the XO lease arrangement yesterday, because now we have a clear field in front of us to not 
only densify with 4G, but use that same capital dollar to get the infrastructure in place for 5G. So we think we're in a very strong 
competitive position. 

 T

conservative than we needed to be. The Boston effort that we've got underway now will further solidify that opinion. 

he point of my comments, and Boston is our good example there, is the farther we push fiber out into the network the more small-cell 
technology works for us. And the cost trade-off that we expected prior to the last auction told us that we would be better off going with 
the small cells than we would paying the prices that the spectrum was demanding. 

 T

CDMA spectrum as we go forward and I expect that we've got plenty of headroom here. 

oday, just to say it, about 50% of our spectrum is dedicated to 4G LTE. We still have some spectrum on 2G. We are refarming our 

 T

David, thanks for your question. Let me go first on the spectrum side and then Fran can cover the first part of your question about 
growth rates. 

Lowell McAdam  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO  

nd then second, just I think in Lowell's commentary he referenced a view that spectrum is not necessarily the be-all end-all for creating 
capacity at the margin. In the notes out this morning, you noted that 93% of the data traffic is on LTE capacity. I was wondering if you 
could refresh us as to where or how much of your spectrum portfolio is dedicated to LTE and how much is still available to be tapped to 
kind of continue to support that 40%-plus growth rate in consumption. Thanks.

digit normal earnings growth expectations for next year. Could you just confirm that those two are the same thing? 

irst, Fran, you highlighted a GDP level of revenue growth next year. I think in the past you've talked about a kind of mid to high single-

ablets, we believe once we get through the churn headwind of the free promo, they will become a bigger contributing factor next year. 

 T

David, on the second part, on the 2017 numbers: yes, GDP revenue growth for 2017. We have done a lot of work behind this 
obviously; what we've talked about around service revenue plays a big factor in this and the comps year over year. But we believe 
some of these other things start to really generate some top-line revenue, like IoT, 25% year-over-year growth rate now. We see that 
accelerating. 

So there's a lot of things that go into that, but we are pretty confident on that GDP growth.

ow the process we are moving into now is actually going out into a field environment where we can cover a 200-home development 
and see with normal vegetation, with difference in weather patterns, where we think this -- these critical parameters are going to go. 
Theoretically, it looks -- 1,000 meters or so between cell sites seems to be reasonable, but again, we've got to verify that. We're going 
to go into some rural environments to see whether that propagation changes based on demand. We will know a lot more as we go 
along. 

 N

e have typically seen speeds above 1 gigabit over, let's just say, 500 yards or less, because of the combined space that we've got 
available to us. With that sort of speed we've been able to put up six ultra high-definition TVs, six virtual-reality units, numerous tablets, 
etc., so those services are only drawing in the 300 to 400 megs of throughput. So lots of headroom. 

 W

Okay, I will take the first part again on 5G. What we've had so far, Phil, is we've got a big deployment down in Dallas working with 
Ericsson and Nokia. We've got several in New Jersey and some down in Virginia. 

o when we deploy 4G and densify that small cell can contain 5G for very little incremental cost. With the router in the house being 
probably less than an ONT and router combination today and losing the wiring in the house and losing the drop, we expect there to be a 
significant cost reduction. 

 S

rom a pure cost perspective, again I think it's a little too early to tell, but what I will tell you is about half of our cost to deploy FiOS is in 
the home today and the next biggest thing outside the home is the drop. And so our take is that with the router roughly costing the 
same -- and, remember, we wouldn't have to have an ONT as we think about it today. 

 F

ut we will know a lot more as we finish these trials. I fully expect that as we wrap these trials up we will actually be bringing some 

 B

analysts and some of the media to the field to take a look at these deployments so that you can judge for yourself. 

Lowell McAdam  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO  

hen, Fran, you mentioned tablets are slower but you do expect a rebound once churn falls away. Do these add value? Is it mostly just 

 T

First of all, can you help us understand the progress on the 5G trials? What are you learning about the cost of deployment, usable 
distances, and speeds? 

tacking on, pulling those customers in more tightly, or do they actually add value economically on their own? Thanks. 

Fran Shammo  - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO  

Then, Phil, on the second part on tablets, so absolutely we view tablets as adding value. Traditionally you would say, well, a tablet that 
is added to a wireless account just gives you a minimal amount of access revenue and that's far less than a smartphone. And all that is 
true. 

Then on the bottom line, all I've said -- I've never given a percentage, but all I've said is a normal growth rate for Verizon. What that 
means is exclude the last two prior years where we bought Vodafone and got a 10% increment over our normal growth rate and then, 
of course, the prior year, which was impacted by the EIP accounting. 

o that's all I've said and we'll talk more about that when we get to the first quarter of next year.

But if you look at the entire ecosystem that we are developing here, more people who have tablets we know watch more video on a 
tablet. And if you think about what Lowell outlined on our whole video strategy along with go90, AOL, Yahoo coming into the portfolio 
fold, we are trying to drive more usage into these devices and we want those users to consume content, which then ultimately drives 
advertising. 

o we're looking at the value of these instruments, if you will, more from a holistic standpoint. Yes, today it's 11.4% of the base. I still 
believe that there is a huge growth opportunity here in the base with tablets and where technology is going. And that is going to 
generate not only access revenue on the Wireless side of the house, but it's also going to generate a lot of, if you will, MediaCo type 
revenue for the future portfolio of digital advertising.

 O

ust following up on Phil's point, Lowell, you mentioned doing in Boston into other cities. Can I just explore that a little bit? Are you 
talking in your franchise footprint, your Wireline footprint, or going outside of that? Because I guess the logical next question would be, 
outside of that, how do you work with the incumbents there if you are kind of trying to cannibalize their main business? 

 J

hen, secondly, if you can offer any commentary on FirstNet, if you guys are there, and any thoughts on that. Thanks a lot. 

 T

ow, as far as cannibalization, there's an awful lot of dark fiber providers out there. We've had a lot of discussions with them and they 

 N

are very happy to sell, and they've got very good footprints that get deep into some of these networks. 

s I mentioned, we've obviously just purchased XO; 40 metro fiber rings, which get us into a very strong position. And there's 

 A

s far as FirstNet, under federal contracting rules we really can't comment about that while there's an RFP in process so I'm sorry I

companies out there like XO so we don't view any issue there.

going to leverage that in our work with them. But there's no boundary. 

 I

Okay, first on the cities, Jennifer. Absolutely; there's no boundary here on our Wireline footprint. Obviously we have a stronger position 
in the Washington to Boston corridor. We can move to market more quickly, but we don't view that as a barrier at all.

Thanks for taking the question. Lowell, early on you started off talking about the importance of network. It's interesting; investors have 
increasingly been asking whether networks really are sufficiently differentiated versus what we have been accustomed to. And of

 would argue that if you need to sell your product at half of what Verizon sells theirs, that's proof alone that networks matter if you have 
to take that sort of a haircut. I know it's shocking, but occasionally advertisements are out there that aren't completely truthful. But that's 
the world that we live in. 

 I

Brett, thanks. You know, I think since we started with the original network reliability message back in 2000, those that weren't number 
one have constantly said networks don't matter. And customers have voted that networks do matter and all you have to do is look at the 
churn. 

nd so the throughputs, the latency, that's where the battleground shifts. How we stay ahead is by densifying the 4G LTE network, but 
then driving very hard to 5G. Because we have seen this time and time again throughout the history of Verizon, and I would argue 
throughout the history of wireless, is if you build it they will come. And the more we build, the more speeds that we deliver, the more 
ubiquitous the network is, the customers just soak up that broadband capacity. 

 A

s far as differentiation, as we say around the business, I think we've said this in other -- I don't think it's made it to an ad yet, but "can 
you hear me now" has really moved to "can you see me now." And that's because we've moved away from voice being a channel and 
an application by itself on these networks to it just rides the data stream. 

 A

erizon has always been the one that is pushing the envelope here and we continue to do that. So I hope everyone on the call sees 
that by aggressively moving to densification and then using that same infrastructure to build out 5G, Verizon is going to stay on the 
leading edge for the next decade. 

 V

Lowell McAdam  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO  

course, some of your competitors are arguing that actually there is not a lot of differentiation anymore and people should be more 
focused on things like price. So I was hoping we could come back to that. 

hen just if we think about the evolution of how you've differentiated. It used to be you differentiated on the reliability of voice; more 
recently it's been the reliability of data and data speeds. Where is the battleground shifting and how are you going to make sure you 
continue to be differentiated based on where that's going?

Thank you, two quick questions if I could. Lowell, can you talk about the FCC's privacy NPRM and what could be significantly stricter 
rules for ISPs like Verizon relative to edge providers like Google or Facebook? Did that impact your thinking about what you could pay 
for Yahoo and how you monetize Yahoo in any way? 

hen second, just a more tactical question. Can you talk about the FiOS installation backlogs coming out of the work stoppage and 

 T

what we can expect with some rebound there? 

Lowell McAdam  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO  

Good morning, Craig. So on the FCC privacy NPRM -- and I would also apply this to the set-top box side. You know we are not a big 
fan of regulation in general; we would rather let the markets work. But if there's going to be regulation, then we think it ought to be for all 
the players in the ecosystem.

THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS  |  www.streetevents.com  |  Contact Us 

Craig, one thing on the FiOS installation backlogs, yes, obviously coming out of the -- when we settled with the representative 
employees there was a large backlog. I would tell you, as we sit here right now today, that backlog is down to a normal, but I would say 
that in my prepared remarks I said we would get back to a normal growth in the third quarter. 

ut I will caveat that comment and say that, look, during the strike we discontinued all advertising and it takes about 60 to 90 days to 
ramp that backup. So albeit the third quarter will be more positive quarter for us, it probably won't be as much as a normal third quarter 
for us. So a little less than norm and then we feel that we will be back in stride by fourth quarter. 

 B

o that kind of lays the land of how we think about FiOS backlog and installation going forward. 

 S

Fran Shammo  - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO  

And I know, and I've talked with Tom Wheeler and I have great respect for what he is doing. He has only got so many tools in his 
toolbox to help set some of the standards here, but we are encouraging a broader action here that might involve the FTC or others so 
that everyone in the ecosystem is treated the same. And I think that's our philosophy on set-top box; that's our philosophy on privacy. 

id it impact us on Yahoo? No, not particularly. We look at that as a standalone business. Certainly, the regulatory environment always 
enters into your thinking, but we would do Yahoo regardless of however that NPRM turns out and we think it's going to be a dynamic 
business for us going forward. So I hope that helps.

f you look at our purchase of Complex, Complex has more visitors per month now than ESPN does in that male Millennial and 
AwesomenessTV has the same sort of numbers for female Millennials. So it gives -- whether you are thinking you are part of a large 
network sports distribution or you are the actual league or you are trying to deliver finance or other news, being able to tap into that is a 
huge opportunity. 

 I

he big advertisers have come to us saying that they have more ads to place than they have good places to put them and so you will 

 T

hen the final, probably obvious one to everyone, but we have 113.2 million mobile users and people are accessing all of this content 
via their mobile device. We will be one of the few that can deliver advertising and content across the home, across the mobile device, 
and across the Internet. We think that puts us in a very, very strong position. 

 T

hear from us over the next several months some partnerships and some agreements to place ads with us. 

 think every content provider, and I think it's fair to say whether you are an advocate for the 300 channel bundle or over-the-top, you 
realize that this is moving more and more toward digital distribution. And the partnership of AOL and Yahoo gives them the ability to 
reach those specific customers. 

 I

Look, I think the items that I mentioned around the sports, finance, and news are really the big items there. If you look at Tim's 
numbers, he is in the hundreds of millions of users. Yahoo is well over 1 billion users. So you start putting those numbers together and 
there's some significant reach here. 

 Lowell McAdam  - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO  

y the time that we get the licenses -- now we've got a great ruling yesterday by the FCC on allowing us to use the leases, so that 
could accelerate some of that. But I will tell you, to get to a commercial launch and actually start to generate revenue; I think that will 
come in either very late 2017, early 2018. But there is nothing in the forecast right now based on the guidance I gave. 

 B

Then, Tim, on the second part of this, I can honestly tell you that within the comments I made there is actually nothing related to 5G as 
far as revenue goes. And the reason for that is because we looked at 2017 as a development year for 5G.

 realize that it's been a long call today and we covered a lot of topics, both operationally and strategically. But given what we said last 
year about 2016 being a plateau for us on earnings and given the acquisitions that we have completed, obviously Yahoo the most 
significant now in front of us, we thought it was good to give you this sort of an overview and update.

JULY 27, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Before Matt goes through the results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $1.07 per share on
a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pretax gain of
about $1.8 billion. This net gain consists primarily of the sale of certain data centers to Equinix. We also incurred pretax severance charges of $607
million, and acquisition- and integration-related charges of $152 million, primarily in connection with the closing of our acquisition of Yahoo's
operating assets, which we've previously disclosed.

The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $458 million, or $0.11 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted
earnings per share was $0.96 in the second quarter compared to $0.94 a year ago. As a reminder, last year's adjusted earnings per share included
$0.07 from the impact of the work stoppage.

Also our consolidated results for the second quarter included one month of data center operations that we sold to Equinix on May 1, 2017, and
about 2 weeks of Yahoo operations. We have posted unaudited historical wireline segment results, which recast the segment for the impact of the
sale to Equinix on our website.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter of execution.

First, we invested in our 4G network leadership position, resulting in a sweep of third-party network performance surveys for the first half of 2017,
while prepositioning for 5G services.

Second, we delivered solid wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment with an increase in both postpaid
and prepaid accounts.

Third, we successfully completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets to scale our media business.

Network leadership is the central element of our strategy, and we are continually investing in our network to extend our leadership in 4G capacity
growth with densification using small cells, which includes expanding our fiber capabilities. As we prepare for the network of the future, we
announced the acquisition of Straight Path for $3.1 billion, which we expect will close by the end of first quarter 2018. Straight Path complements
our spectrum portfolio and positions us to lead and further drive 5G technology and its ecosystem. We have begun the pre-commercial fixed
wireless trials in 8 out of the 11 markets and have our first batch of customers on this technology. As we have previously highlighted, we will have
trial results later in the year, and I look forward to sharing them with you.

We had a strong quarter adding and retaining wireless customers as the momentum from the launch of our unlimited plans was sustained throughout
the quarter. We delivered a strong wireless operational performance that reflects customer demand for our high-quality network in a highly
competitive market.

Finally, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and immediately began executing on integration plans that we've been working
on for over a year. We are confident in the execution of our strategy, which we expect to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows and
return long-term value to our shareholders.

Let's go deeper into the second quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by wireless and wireline results, media and
telematics progress, and network and technology updates.

Now on to Slide 6. In the second quarter, total operating revenue was in line with last year. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and
acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined 2.0%. The primary driver was the decrease in wireless service revenue, which was consistent with our
expectation. On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.2%.

JULY 27, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We remain focused on improving our overall cost structure through operating efficiencies across network, distribution and care. As we shift more
transactions toward a digital model, we can improve the customer experience and further enhance operating efficiencies.

Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Our operating segments continue to generate substantial cash flows. During the first
half of 2017, cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.9 billion and included a net after-tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion.
Our high-quality cash generation is driven by the diverse base of wireless and wireline customers. Our ongoing asset-backed securitization program
provided $2.9 billion of cash, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The impact of the transition to device payment
plans and on balance sheet securitization should approach a steady state around the end of 2017. Thereafter, the sequential impacts will primarily
reflect seasonality of new device launches. As a result, we expect working capital headwind to subside in 2018.

For the first half of the year, capital spending was $7.0 billion, which is in line with last year. On a year-to-date basis, our reported free cash flow of
$2.9 billion includes the discretionary pension contribution, net of tax, of $2.1 billion, which flowed through our cash flow from operations. In
addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset-backed securitization, which was introduced in the third quarter of last year.

Our balance sheet is solid and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $117.5 billion of total debt,
which comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on-balance sheet securitizations.

We have not changed our capital allocation plan or our expectation for cash availability. And we remain focused on having a strong balance sheet
with improving credit metrics, while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders.

Now let's move into reviews of the operating segment, starting with wireless on Slide 8. In a highly competitive wireless environment, we delivered
a strong operational performance protecting and expanding our high-valued postpaid customer relationships, while balancing profitability. With
a clear and comparable offer, our value proposition highlighted the strength of our network, resulting in industry-leading customer retention and
improved new demand during the quarter as our offer appealed to customers in underpenetrated segments.

Wireless operational performance was sustained throughout the second quarter, building on the customer momentum at the end of the first
quarter with improvements in both sequential and year-over-year net phone add performance. Net phone additions were 358,000 compared to
86,000 in the prior year. Smartphone net additions were 590,000 versus 336,000 last year. Postpaid net adds totaled 614,000, including tablet net
adds of 2,000 and other connected devices of 254,000, led by Verizon Wireless retail hum devices. We added 64,000 postpaid accounts versus a
loss of 83,000 last year. And we grew our postpaid account base for the first time in the past 6 quarters.

Our postpaid phone churn reflects customer demand for network quality and reliability, while pricing provided choices to meet customer needs.
Postpaid phone churn not only continued recent trends below 0.9%, but also established a new low in the LTE era at 0.70%. Total retail postpaid
churn of 0.94% was consistent year-over-year and down 21 basis points sequentially.

Total postpaid device activations were up 3.0%, of which 82% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.6%, up from 5.4% year-over-year
and was 43 basis points higher sequentially. During the quarter, 6.2 million phones were activated on device payment plans.

Prepaid net adds of 19,000 were up year-over-year and sequentially due to our stronger value proposition.

Let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 1.9% in the second quarter
as compared to a 5.1% decline in the first quarter. Service revenue declined 6.7% versus a 6.1% decrease in the previous quarter. This trend was
primarily due to the lost overage revenue, driven by plans introduced during summer of 2016 and the introductory unlimited offer. As we discussed
during our last earnings call, we expected weaker year-over-year service revenue through the first half of the year, primarily due to line access and
overage revenue trends. At the end of the second quarter, about 59% of our accounts have tools that offer customers the ability to self-manage
their usage experience.

During the second quarter, we experienced an improvement in the rate of decline in line access revenue as we now have roughly 75% of the
postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans. We expect this trend will continue, which, combined with adding new accounts and migrating

customers to higher access points, will mitigate the lost overage revenue. Therefore, we believe the service revenue trend has flattened. And we
expect that there will be an improving trend in the second half and we should exit the fourth quarter inside a decline of 4.0%.

In the second quarter, equipment revenue increased 16%. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the
quarter as compared to approximately 76% in the first quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent
with recent experience. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan at the end of the quarter.

Our wireless EBITDA margin, as a percent of total revenue, was 45.8%. The movement in the service revenue trend will also positively impact wireless
EBITDA margin.

Let's move next to our wireline segment on Slide 10. Total wireline revenue on a reported basis grew 1.2%, including the recently acquired XO
operations. On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.8% compared to a decline of 3.2% last quarter. The shift in the wireline
revenue trend towards fiber is growing. Organically, fiber-based products grew more than 3%, which supports our plans to further invest in fiber.

Our emphasis on delivering value to all business customers from the very small to the large enterprise was recognized recently in a leading third-party
study. More importantly, we won the large enterprise business award for the second consecutive year in the same study.

Consumer markets revenue increased 0.6%, driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue growth of 4.1% was consistent with the past
several quarters. During the quarter, we launched Fios Gigabit Connection in certain markets, which offers symmetrical speeds of up to 1 gigabit
per second. In Fios Internet, we added 49,000 customers. Fios Video results were pressured due to softer secular demand for traditional linear video,
given growth in the over-the-top offerings as well as competitive promotional activity. Fios Video losses were 15,000 in the quarter.

For the second quarter, enterprise solutions revenue fell 4.1% on an organic basis, which was due to persistent trends in our legacy products and
pricing compression in the marketplace. On a constant currency basis, revenue was down 3.5%.

Partner solutions revenue declined 6.8% on an organic basis, while the revenue mix towards fiber has been trending higher. Within business
markets, fiber revenue is expanding, driven by Fios broadband demand, offset by continued pressure in legacy products. On an organic basis,
revenue declined 4.9% and improved slightly sequentially.

On a comparable basis, the second quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 20.8% compared to 13.3%, which includes the work stoppage last year.
Sequentially, wireline EBITDA margin was down 120 basis points, primarily due to lower revenue from enterprise solutions and partner solutions
and an increase in operating expense as a result of leasing data center space related to the sale to Equinix.

Let's move next to Slide 11 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. On June 13, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's
operating assets. Upon closing, we launched Oath, which is a combination of AOL and Yahoo brands, serving approximately 1 billion unique
monthly users globally and currently represents about $7 billion in annual revenue. We have been planning the integration of AOL and Yahoo for
the past year and immediately began executing on integration plans upon closing. We expect to realize over $1 billion in cumulative operating
expense synergies through 2020.

We are in the very early stages of leveraging the scale of the combined assets to distribute and monetize content through programmatic advertising
across our sports, finance, news and entertainment properties. These properties will provide unique advertising opportunities to targeted global
audiences.

Organically, AOL's revenue, net of traffic acquisition costs, was consistent with prior year's results in the quarter. As the integration progresses, we
will provide additional information on the Oath business.

Organically, IoT revenue, including telematics, increased approximately 20% in the second quarter. Telematics' revenue was approximately $220
million in the quarter.

JULY 27, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Let's move next to Slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our wireless and wireline assets to ensure that we have
capacity, reduce the cost to serve and to preposition the networks for the future. Our value proposition to our wireless customers is to provide a
full network experience, including reliability, coverage and speed. We are on our wireless network plan to deliver the industry's best overall
experience for our customers. Our network experience continues to be recognized by multiple third-party studies as the industry leader. Since the
launch of Unlimited, 2 of these studies have reconfirmed our network leadership in overall performance, including speed and voice quality over
LTE. As expected, the introduction of the Unlimited pricing plan increased the LTE network usage as our customers enjoy the experience of
consuming more data throughout the day on the industry-leading wireless network. We are confident in our network and have been engineering
the network based on a long-term integrated plan to extend our high-quality experience, while expanding our value proposition for customers.
We remain focused on delivering an increasing capacity over the long term, utilizing a 3-pronged approach: first, network features; second,
densification; and third, spectrum. Let's discuss each of these in detail.

First, we are methodically deploying LTE advanced features to increase capacity on our network resources and align with the timing of smartphone
introductions that can take advantage of these features.

Second, small cells are playing a vital role in creating capacity. The densification efforts have been a focal point of our network strategy over the
past several years. This density also creates increased spectral efficiency and offers the best wireless experience.

Finally, with nearly all of our network traffic now on the 4G LTE advanced network, we are utilizing just over 50% of our low- and mid-band spectrum
portfolio for this network. We expect to use more of our PCS spectrum for LTE and are just beginning to redeploy 850 megahertz spectrum in
certain markets.

In addition, we are deploying AWS-3 and will start to add unlicensed spectrum later this year. Our spectrum deployments, in conjunction with
multi-carrier aggregation technology, are enabling us to increase network capacity.

Our overall wireless network integrates features, densification and spectrum to enable a step function increase in wireless network capacity over
the long term.

Fiber is a critical element in transforming both wireless and wireline networks to reduce cost and expand future capabilities. To enhance this
strategy, our recent announcements to secure fiber demonstrates our commitment to increase our multiuse fiber footprint and build fiber deeper
into the network.

On the 5G wireless front, we are up and running in 8 out of the 11 pre-commercial fixed wireless broadband trials on the millimeter wave spectrum.
We have the first batch of customers on the network. We will have trial results towards the end of the year that will give us valuable insights for
commercial deployments.

Let's move next to Slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. We are executing on our plan to lead in network, preserve and grow our
customer relationships and expand our presence in digital media and telematics to deliver fundamental results, while allocating capital to continue
to invest in our operations and return value to our shareholders. We delivered strong wireless operational performance and financial results in a
competitive environment. We evolved our wireless value proposition, while driving profitable growth and reconfirming network leadership based
on third-party study results. We expect that we will create incremental capital and operational efficiencies that result in additional cash generation.

Our 5G strategy is progressing for fixed and mobility use cases, standards, spectrum resources and fiber investments. Now that we have completed
the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and introduced the Oath brand, our media business is focused on the integration plans and will look
to increase engagement on our platforms.

In telematics, we see additional growth opportunities with our Fleetmatics and Telogis assets. We remain confident in our strategy, which puts us
in a strong position to compete today and into the future, while delivering long-term value to our shareholders.

With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.

JULY 27, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Mike Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you, Matt. Eunice, we're now ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD and U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Two questions, if I could. One is curious if you could delve a little bit further into the competitive environment. Last earnings call, you provided a
perspective of how net adds and gross adds flowed over the quarter. I was wondering if you could do the same thing just so we could frame what
was driving the improvement in your performance this quarter on the phone add side of the equation. And then secondly, just on 5G, if you can
give us an update where you are with trials and maybe if you have update on the economics that you're seeing from those deployments.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the questions. So on the competitive environment through the quarter, I would say we saw that it -- our performance in
the quarter was pretty even. You saw the churn number, we came in at 0.70%. That certainly contributed to the net adds and shows that once we
had a comparable offer out there against the competition, I mean, by being unlimited where the other guys were unlimited, even with the price
premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver. And we saw that as we -- throughout the
quarter. So even as we headed into the back end of the quarter and the competitive environment picked up and some of the other offers that
came out there, whether that be large bounties to switch carrier or offering free service, our performance in the back end of the quarter was
consistent with where we saw in the first part of the quarter. So we saw a great result from customers on both the gross adds side and the loyalty
side once they had that comparable offer to do. So very excited about how that played out. As we head forward, second quarter is typically seasonally
the low quarter for churn. So while we certainly expect churn to continue to be at low levels, we'll see if we get normal seasonal uptick as we go
forward. But from a competitive environment standpoint, I think we showed that we competed throughout the quarter without having to put any
aggressive promotions in place in the market at any time during the quarter. In terms of 5G, I think, as I said in the prepared remarks, we now have
the trials up and running. It's going to be later in the year before we start to see results out of those trials. And then in terms of the business model
and economics that may come out of that, it will be driven by the results we see from the trials. So too early right now to be more definitive on
that, but we're still confident that we'll have a commercial product in market during 2018 and look forward to providing more details on what's
coming out of the trials and the overall economics that we see when we get into the latter part of the year.

Operator

Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

First, can we talk about your small cell rollout? Where are we in the path of that? I know it's a multiyear effort, but how far are we into the small cell
rollout and densification? And second, can you talk about the competitive environment in video and broadband? As you add up the OTT trends
and traditional video losses, do you see an acceleration in cord cutting? Or does it just seem like customers are spreading out among more video
service providers?

JULY 27, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. Thanks, Phil. So on the small cell rollout, we're exactly where we planned to be. I mean, our capital plan for the year, we're right on where we
plan to be at the start of the year. And we are now -- I would say, we have small cell builds in all of the top metro markets at this point. And that's
one of the reasons we have the network performance that we've had. We saw confirmation of that as recently as yesterday with another one of
the third-party surveys that proves that during the first quarter of '17. Even once we are on unlimited, our network performs better than anybody
else's, and that's in large part due to what we've been doing for the past number of years on small cell densification. I know you hear a lot of other
people talk a lot about small cell densification now. Remember that we've been doing that for a longer time period than anyone else. And that's
why we're in all of the top metro markets, and we will continue to do that. That will be a continued part of our network capacity plan. As we talked
about in the prepared remarks, we have the long-term network plan that's based off continuing to deploy the spectrum that we own against the
LTE network, densification and the LTE tools that are available. So densification continues to be a very important part of our network plan. From a
competitive environment in the broadband and TV space, I think what you saw is we had a continued strong performance on the broadband side,
but we also see the ongoing secular trend around video. So we continued to add high-quality broadband customers. And we'll continue to compete
on the video side. But certainly, we do that in the face of the secular trends that are ongoing.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Is there a point, Matt, at which the small cell densification efforts sort of starts to slow down in a few years? Or is this a constant effort for the next
3, 5 years?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

I think it continues. And it's not just around 4G. If you -- as we've talked in the past, as we see 5G being deployed on millimeter wave spectrum,
that's going to require small cell deployment. And so as we put the densification in place of 4G, we're doing it in mind knowing that we've got the
5G that will be put to use in the same dark fiber and other assets. So the densification activity will continue here for a good number of years.

Operator

Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group, and Telco and Pay TV
Analyst

Matt, maybe can we get some more color on a couple of the forward-looking sort of items you gave us on the wireless side? First, on the service
revenue, it was down 6.7%, but you said it would start to sort of flatten in the second half. So that -- so can I assume -- and then the 4% sort of
year-end exit run rate, can I assume we're looking at something around 6.7% for the third quarter and then improvement is something in the sort
of 5% range for the fourth quarter? Just if we could get some color there. And then similarly, on the margins, you said as the service revenue
improved, we'll see some improvement in the margins. Total margins on wireless have been down a little bit in the first half on each quarter. Does
that mean -- are you sort of suggesting it will be down less in the second half? Or do you think that, as we see the improvement into the year,
obviously, there are some crosscurrents with the new phone, but can we get back at flat or even positive comps on the margin?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. Thanks, John. So on the service revenue, I think consistent with what we've said earlier in the year, we see second quarter as being the low
point. And the 6.7% for 2Q will become something better than in the 3Q. And in my prepared remarks, I believe I -- you heard me say that we'll be
inside of negative 4% in the fourth quarter. So in terms of the -- how do we get there, we talked about that 75% of the base in the second quarter

was on unsubsidized pricing. That compares to 53% a year ago. So there's north of a 20-point movement from second quarter last year to second
quarter this year. As you get into the back half of the year, I'll use fourth quarter as an example, fourth quarter a year ago, that number was 67%.
That -- this year, that number is going to top out in the upper 70s. So we're at 75% now. We'll get up to, let's say, 77%. That will only be a 10-point
delta in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So that pressure that's come from taking customers from the subsidized model down to the unsubsidized
pricing is starting to wane. And really, the second quarter is where we've reached the point we've got essentially the vast majority of the consumer
base now on unsubsidized pricing. And then overage revenues also being part of the -- obviously, part of the story here over the past few quarters.
First, with the introduction of the price plans last year that had the safety mode feature and then bring on unlimited, as we said, we now have 59%
of accounts on 1 of those 2 plans. Overage was actually down 34% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. And it now represents a low
single-digit percentage part of total service revenue. So we're working through that headwind. We'll work through that headwind a lot faster. And
so as I say, based off that, I am very confident we'll be inside 4%, negative 4% in fourth quarter. And by the time we get on this call a year from now
and our comparison is against this year being 75% on unsubsidized pricing, we'll be having a very different conversation about the service revenue
trajectory next year. And then on margin improvement, as you know, service revenue is the highest margin component of our business. So as the
trajectory on service revenue improves, the trajectory on margin will improve as well.

Operator

Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

I guess, 2, if I could. I just wanted to follow up on that service revenue question. Matt, I mean, the math kind of suggests that by fourth quarter,
your service revenue will actually be growing from where it is in the second quarter. And I wonder if you could kind of talk about the inputs to that
expectation in terms of the kind of what you expect from a competitive pricing environment, promotions with the iPhone, et cetera, relative to
that mix shift that you've been talking about as you kind of go past the price down cohort and you move into this group of people that are kind
of more pricing up. If you could talk about those 2 dynamics this kind of inputs as your base case, it will be helpful. And then the second question,
if I could, would be on the media segment. I mean, if you could kind of elaborate a little bit more on what is that thing growing at today and what
will it look like in the future. I guess, we've talked about maybe turning down the search business and how that business might transform over the
next 6 months or a year, kind of be helpful to kind of understand what that unit is going to look like.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes, David. Thank you. So the inputs to service revenue, really, if you think about that trajectory changing, when you've got growing accounts,
growing net adds, when you see the continued improvement in the delta on the nonsubsidized pricing and as we work through the overage, all
of that will combine to a much stronger trend as we go forward from where we have been. In terms of the impact of any new devices coming along,
we assume that we'll see something later in the year. We typically are -- have very strong results when we have new devices come out because
when customers get a new device with new functions, they want it on the best network, but we'll see what happens there. And certainly, we'd
expect that to be accretive to the overall revenue story. But our guidance for the year doesn't require any major uplift as a result of that. And then
the media side, look, I will say it was very early in the process of integrating those 2 businesses. As we've said, the revenue of AOL less TAC was flat
year-over-year in the quarter. Tim and the team are just getting started integrating those 2 businesses. They're about 45 days in at this point. The
integration is going well. And I look forward to being able to provide more color and commentary about exactly what they're seeing as they go
forward. But as you heard Tim say a couple of months ago, the goal here is to grow this to north of $10 billion in revenue by 2020. And nothing
that's happened since we closed has changed our view on that.

JULY 27, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

A question for Matt. And if I'm reading your guidance correctly, it seems like you effectively reiterated your outlook for the year, including what
implies roughly a flattish EPS trend. There were a few moving parts this quarter. You did the Equinix data center deal, and I think that may have
been slightly dilutive to earnings. And of course, you completed the acquisition of Yahoo. So I was hoping maybe you could just unpack your
outlook for the full year and maybe let us know the extent to which those transactions may have been accretive or dilutive to your trends for the
balance of 2017.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. Thanks, Brett. So the guide, if you look at the language on the revenue side, it's -- we said we'd be reasonably consistent on an organic basis.
So as we think about that, we would remove out anything that wasn't in the business for all of 2016, 2017. So certainly, the impact of those businesses
have been -- having about $0.02 a quarter on EPS. So when I think about the guide going forward, it's on an organic basis. Still, feel very confident,
organically, we'll be in a consistent place to where we were a year ago. And then we'll bake in the impact of the various acquisitions as we go
forward.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

Does that imply that it's actually additive to your full year outlook? (inaudible)

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

As we get into each of those businesses, certainly, from a revenue standpoint, they are additive to the outlook. From an earnings standpoint, some
of those businesses have an initial pressure as we integrate them, but not material to the earnings outlook.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

And then just a different question. If you think about unlimited and you were talking about doing more digital interactions and customer care,
have you already started to see a benefit there? In other words, as your customer base has moved to unlimited plans, is that cohort contacting you
less frequently? And could this be a real area of offset to some of the overage that you're losing on the top line?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes, absolutely. I mean, certainly, with customers on unlimited, they have fewer reasons to call and -- but we continue to want to improve the
customer experience. And when customers can do the things by themselves through a digital channel at the time they want to do it, that increases
overall satisfaction. And it certainly allows us to improve the efficiency of the business. So we're continuing to do that. And we think Unlimited,
certainly, helps us do that as well.

JULY 27, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Partner and Senior Research Analyst

Matt, I wonder if we could return to the network densification conversation you had a few moments ago. Can you talk about how you think about
the trade-off specifically between acquiring more spectrum and network densification and -- from an economics perspective? And has that shifted
at all inside of Verizon? I mean, my sense is you're much different than a year or so ago. You're -- you spend less time talking about new spectrum
acquisition. Is that a fair characterization?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

I don't -- look, we continue to look at that trade-off. It really comes down to taking a view on the most efficient way to add the capacity that we
need. And we've talked for 2 or 3 years now about the fact that we believe based off of the valuations that spectrum have reached in some places,
it's more efficient to densify. And certainly, the cost of densification, just like with any technology, have come down to some degree since we started
densifying with small cells. So the overall analysis we do hasn't fundamentally changed. Look, we continue to add spectrum from the secondary
markets, too. So when spectrum is priced at the right level, we continue to be active in that space, too. And we just look at the relative economics
between densifying and adding spectrum. But densification has proved to be a very effective way of adding capacity in what places we need to
and from a on a cost-efficiency standpoint as well.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Partner and Senior Research Analyst

And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. I'm going to risk putting words in your mouth. But is it fair to say that you still believe, broadly speaking,
that network advantage is still possible and within reach for Verizon with the network densification strategy?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Look, I think the results speak for themselves on this one, Craig. And whether it be the third-party results that you're seeing, again, just in the last
24 hours, but even in an unlimited world, the third-party results clearly show that Verizon has the best network. And then when you look at our
subscriber metrics for the quarter, once we are on a comparable basis, we saw a record low churn down at 0.70%, sorry, and we also saw a strong
net add number. So the idea that network differentiation doesn't matter to customers, quite frankly, the results from our base showed that, that's
not true. And customers do value the benefit of a differentiated network experience, even when it's at the premium pricing, which is where ours
is. We wouldn't get those results if a better network experience didn't matter to customers. Clearly, it does.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst

Matt, maybe just a little deeper on the churn that we saw in the quarter. Obviously, a very strong result there. Is it an impact from more EIP customers
and sort of the equipment balances keeping people steady? Was there anything you guys were doing with respect to protecting the base with
maybe proactively moving to unsubsidized without the EIP payments? And then just following up again on the guide on service revenue. What's
the more important driver here for the year? Is it handset additions maintaining sort of a positive posture? Or is it the ARPA starting to turn? Or
obviously, could it be a combination of both?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. Thanks, Mike. So on the churn, look, there's no magic in here. It's not that we've got more customers on EIP or we've been doing things behind
the scenes to protect the base. It's around the quality of the experience. And customers see that quality of the experience and they choose to --

they want to be on that experience rather than something else. So we're very, very happy with the -- that number there. And it's just a reflection
of what we give customers. And in terms of the guide on service revenue, I think the biggest piece that you have in there is the continued migration
of the base to the nonsubsidized pricing plans in the back half of the year. The year-over-year comps are against higher numbers there versus the
first half of the year, and that's going to drive the improvement in service revenue. Certainly, net account growth is an important contribution. But
I think just the movement off the base and on an unsubsidized, that's the trend we've been talking about, and we certainly see that ahead of us.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst

And, Matt, maybe just a quick follow-up on thoughts on towers. I know one of your biggest competitor, I guess, is looking for alternatives. Are you
guys also evaluating some of those things?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

We continue to look at all ways to manage the network at the most efficient pricing that we have, whether that be how we talk to towers or all the
other resources we have in front of us.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Matt, if I may, on the spectrum side, I know you've talked much about densification, but you didn't mention other spectrum sources. It looks like
there's going to be a 3.5 gigahertz auction possibly next year. And it seems like Verizon has done most lobbying for that effort. In your spectrum
kind of wish list, is it fair to say you're probably more focused on higher-band spectrum at this point? Or if you could comment on that. And then
second, if I may, on the One Fiber initiative, it's certainly early to call 2018 CapEx, but do you still feel comfortable that with the fiber plans you've
laid out or some which we know about, some we probably don't, that, that really won't be a huge increase in the CapEx level next year?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks, Jennifer. So on the spectrum wish list, look, we -- we're very confident in the portfolio of spectrum that we have certainly in low band and
mid-band. And we have a significant amount of spectrum still to deploy against the LTE network. We'd certainly be interested in the 3.5 and look
forward to that coming forward. But as I say, we're very confident in the spectrum that we still have to deploy. From a CapEx standpoint next year,
look, it's too early to get into the guide next year. But as we think about how we deploy fiber and so on, that will be part of the plans. And we'll
share those as we get towards the latter part of the year and certainly into January, when we provide the full year guide.

Operator

Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Matt, you talked a little bit about some of the pressures in the video business from over-the-top. How is Verizon thinking about that opportunity?
Do you -- is there a case for you to have your own over-the-top product to compete? And how do you think -- I know on convergence, you've
typically been conservative, but I think we're seeing a lot more of these converged wireless plus over-the-top offerings, and maybe just touching
then on M&A and what your interest is and potentially owning more content to have some exclusive product for your customers?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks for the question, Simon. So on over-the-top, look, nothing to say there. We're always looking, but we'll see -- we'll continue to evaluate
what we need to do to be competitive in that space and then the need to be part of the portfolio or not. From a convergence standpoint, again,
we are -- we're very comfortable with the product offerings we have today. And if there is more convergence, we certainly believe that will take
place on our networks. And we'll be effective as being part of that. And then from an M&A standpoint, look, we're very comfortable with the assets
we have today. If there's an opportunity to add something or accelerate the strategy at a reasonable price, we will. But we think we have the assets
we need to be effective at this point in time.

Operator

Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst

I was wondering if we could touch upon sort of that network focus and the most efficient means to build additional capacity. When we think about
your fiber footprint, you folks have certainly augmented it via acquisitions as well as some of the announcements that you've made to build out
capacity. Where does it stand at this juncture in terms of the -- not just the fiber footprint itself, but having the right type of fiber assets to deploy
5G? And how do you expect to augment that capacity going forward?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes, thank you. So as we think about the fiber we need for the business, certainly, we need more going forward. As we've discussed in the past, the
way that we're going to add that capacity will be probably through a combination of buying fiber that already exists if it's the right type of fiber.
We can build fiber and we can certainly lease. And we were doing that on top of some of the assets we already own and adding the XO, those fiber
metro rings earlier in the year, gives us the base on which we will continue to do some of that. So fiber will continue to be very important to how
we build the network, not just for wireless, but also various wireline applications, including smart city deployments. So more to come there as we
go forward.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst

That's very helpful, Matt. And then just dovetailing on the prior commentary on over-the-top. Just want to try and put those comments that you
had made in terms of evaluating options with some of the comments that seemed to have been made previously about you folks putting together
an offering. I mean, has that changed in terms of timing or what your strategy is for over-the-top?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

I'd say there's no change to our strategy at this point in time.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Matt, the Unlimited has had an incredible impact here. Do you think this is sustainable? Or are you seeing any slowdown at all? Maybe, I'm not sure
if you said on the call what percentage your base around unlimited or maybe a flow share. And then I -- not to pound you on wireless margins, but
it sounded like you're kind of expecting the trend up for the next several years, not just for this quarter. Do you think we can get back to, on a
consolidated basis, the type of margins we saw last year or even better than that? And I guess, just lastly, how do you balance out the growth in
subscribers with the margins that you're generating, which are still obviously industry-leading?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Yes. Thanks, Tim. So we absolutely think the trend on unlimited is sustainable. Once we gave customers that clear and comparable offer, we see
the value of our network and our offering compared to what else is in the marketplace. And look, we'll see how the marketplace evolves going
forward, but we're very confident that we will be competitive as that happens. From a margin improvement standpoint, look, as service revenue
trends improve, we'd expect that to flow through into margins. And then also we continue to have ways to take cost out of the business and
improve efficiencies in the business, too. So you should think about that as you think about how we go forward in the wireless performance.

Mike Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Okay. Great. And with that, I'd like to just turn the call back over to Matt on this busy earnings morning.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP

Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. We remain confident in our strategy of investing in our networks, while maintaining
and expanding a high-quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We are well positioned to compete in the current
environment, while leading the industry in the 5G ecosystem with our strong network assets. We have the opportunity to do the things at scale,
while delivering value across our portfolio in order to generate shareholder value. We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us and are
confident in our ability to execute our strategy. Thank you for your time today.

Good morning and welcome to the Verizon second-quarter 2018 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being
recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

JULY 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Before I turn the call over to Lowell for his remarks, let me start with a walkthrough of the second-quarter consolidated earnings on slide 3. For the
second quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $1 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like
to highlight.

Our reported earnings this quarter include a charge for product realignment of $658 million, mainly related to the discontinuation of the go90
platform and associated content; severance charges of $339 million; and acquisition- and integration-related charges of $120 million, primarily
consisting of costs pertaining to Oath. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $0.9 billion or $0.20 per share. Excluding the effect
of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was
$0.99 in the second quarter compared to $0.96 a year ago. On a comparable basis, adjusted earnings per share before the impacts of tax reform
and revenue recognition were up 3.1% year over year.

Let's now turn to slide 4. Consistent with the approach we established last quarter, we have provided a table that illustrates the ongoing effects
from the adoption of the revenue recognition standard on our financial results. As a reminder, the adoption of the revenue recognition standard
results in a reduction of the wireless service revenue, offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue, as well as the deferral of commission
expense in both our wireless and wireline segments.

The impact from this change has been fairly consistent throughout the first two quarters of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, the cumulative impact
of revenue recognition was $0.14 per share. For the full year we expect the impact to earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31. The
accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to
revenue and commission costs converge.

For the remainder of this call, financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods,
unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Thank you, Brady; and good morning, everyone. This is the last time I will have to discuss Verizon results with you, so I'd like to take a minute and
offer some perspective after serving as Verizon's CEO for the past seven years.

When I first took over from Ivan in 2011, the Company was well positioned for the future. We were leading the charge in the wireless industry by
pushing the ecosystem and driving new user experiences with our robust launch of 4G LTE service. We were growing our fiber-to-the-home
business, Fios, and expanding penetration in highly competitive markets. The Company had a strong balance sheet and financial profile so that
we had the flexibility to execute whatever strategy we chose.

If I look at where we are today, once again the Company is well positioned for the future. Our financial and operating results for the first half of
2018 are strong, as evidenced by our service revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth.

Verizon has 100% ownership of our wireless business and its industry-leading network and customer base. We have driven the 5G ecosystem by
pushing the industry to adopt the next generation several years ahead of original expectations, and we are positioned to be the clear leader in the
deployment of 5G services based on our technological expertise, asset base, engineering talent, and spectrum portfolio.

This leadership position is attracting opportunities in areas such as over-the-top TV, smart cities, transportation, education, and healthcare, just to
name a few. I believe the impact of 5G on consumers will be much bigger than any previous generation, but the biggest impact will be on businesses
as we provide the platform for the fourth industrial revolution.

We know the consumer requires a mobile-first digital information experience, and the new businesses that we have added -- such as Oath and our
IoT platforms -- are poised to be at the forefront of enhancing our ability to meet this growing customer demand. Our Fios business and our recent
One Fiber expansion have proven that fiber-based network solutions will continue to be in high demand and can take significant share in mature
markets.

JULY 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

The cornerstone of our strategy will always be network leadership and customer experience. Verizon has an outstanding leadership team, a unique
portfolio of assets, solid financial profile, and a strong balance sheet that enables us to deliver on the promise of the digital world.

I'm also pleased to mention our recently announced tentative agreement with our unions to extend our labor contracts through August 2023. This
will give all of our employees the ability to focus on our customers and execute our strategies without disruption. One of my least fond memories
as CEO was a strike five days after taking over. I am glad Hans won't share that experience.

What Brady didn't tell you when he started the call this morning is that the four of us are in Houston, Texas. It is an honor for us to be in Houston
today to talk about our second-quarter results, spend valuable time with our employees in the area, and celebrate the quality of our customers in
this great city. We have an excellent relationship with the city, with Mayor Turner, and with the greater Houston area; and we are very proud of our
overall customer experience, network performance, and community involvement -- especially during some of the hardest times, like Hurricane
Harvey.

Verizon and the nation's best wireless network work tirelessly to provide customers, loved ones, and first responders with an unparalleled level of
reliability and quality when it matters the most. It is with great pleasure that we announce here today Houston as the third of our four initial
commercial launch markets for our 5G residential broadband service that will be rolled out later this year.

This is an exciting time for our Company and the industry. I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that Verizon is making, and our recent
appointment of Hans Vestberg as CEO solidifies the leadership of this great Company for years to come.

As I have said before, I am confident that Hans is the right person to bring Verizon into its next chapter, and he is the energizing force we need to
position Verizon to lead the upcoming fourth Industrial revolution. Matt will now take you through the details of our second-quarter financial
results, which highlight the strength of Verizon. Hans will then outline our strategic priorities and talk about the opportunities that lie ahead.

With that, I will turn the call over to Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Lowell, and thank you for the many years of leadership and the support and encouragement you have provided to all of us.

I'd like to start by reviewing the consolidated results on slide 6. Consolidated revenue was $32.2 billion on a reported basis, including the impacts
of revenue recognition. Excluding the impact of Oath and divested businesses, consolidated revenue was $30.2 billion, an increase of approximately
2.6%.

The wireless business continues to be the primary driver of growth, generating solid service revenue results. On a GAAP-reported basis, we are
expecting low to mid-single-digit percentage consolidated revenue growth for the full year. The update to full-year revenue guidance is due to
better-than-expected equipment revenue trends.

Excluding special items, second-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.6%, down from the prior year's margin of 36.5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased
$0.2 billion due to service revenue performance and as we continue to drive operational efficiencies across the business.

Strong revenue momentum and solid margin performance keep us on track to achieve low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS in 2018
before the net impact of tax reform and revenue recognition. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2018 to be at the low end of our
guided range of 24% to 26%.

Let's now focus on cash flow results and the balance sheet on slide 7. Our business segments are generating substantial cash flows. During the
second quarter of 2018, cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.8 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion from the prior year and $3.1 billion
sequentially. This was driven by strong results from the business, benefits from tax reform, and the completion of the transition to on-balance-sheet
financing of our device payment plan receivables.

JULY 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

For the second quarter capital spending was $3.3 billion, bringing the year-to-date spend to $7.8 billion. We currently expect capital expenditures
for the full year to be closer to the lower end of our guided range of $17.0 billion to $17.8 billion, driven by efficiencies from our business excellence
initiatives and CapEx management process, as well as the Intelligent Edge Network design. 2018 capital expenditures include deploying 5G for
both residential broadband and mobility launches.

Free cash flow totaled $6.5 billion in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with $114.6 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $106.0
billion of unsecured debt and $8.6 billion of secured debt.

As we stated at the beginning of the year, we intend to use the majority of the benefits from tax reform in 2018 to strengthen the balance sheet.
We began to realize these benefits during the second quarter, and our total debt balance declined by $4.4 billion sequentially.

Our capital allocation methodology remains consistent, focused on having a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics while continuing
to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders.

Now let's move on to reviews of the operating segments, starting with wireless on slide 8. Total wireless operating revenue increased 4.7% to $22.3
billion in the second quarter. Service revenue continues to generate strong results, producing a 2.5% increase excluding the impact of revenue
recognition, driven by customer step-ups to higher access plans and increases in the average connections per account.

Sequentially, service revenue increased by 1.5%. On a reported basis, including the impact from revenue recognition, service revenue increased
by 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. Customer migration to unsubsidized pricing continues to approach a steady state, currently at 82% for the
quarter as compared to 75% a year ago and 81% in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, equipment revenue increased 6.8%, driven by higher-priced handsets, more than offsetting a reduction in activation volumes.
Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter, consistent with the prior year.

Our wireless EBITDA was $10.3 billion in the second quarter, which represents an increase of 5.5%. As a percent of total revenue, EBITDA margin
was 46.2%, up from 45.8% a year ago, and was relatively flat on a sequential basis.

Let's now turn to slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. Wireless continues to deliver solid results, driven by the quality of our
network experience and strong customer retention. In the second quarter, net phone additions were 199,000, including 398,000 smartphones.
Postpaid net adds totaled 531,000, including tablet net losses of 37,000, offset by 369,000 other connected devices, led by wearables.

Our postpaid phone churn of 0.75% is a result of our compelling customer experience on the nation's best network. This represents the fifth
consecutive quarter of customer retention at 0.80% or better. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.97% was slightly up compared to 0.94% in the prior
year.

In the quarter, postpaid device activations were 4.6% lower than the prior year, of which about 80% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate
was 5.0% as compared to 5.6% a year ago. During the quarter 5.8 million phones were activated on device payment plans.

Prepaid activity in the quarter reflected a total net loss of 236,000 devices compared to 19,000 prepaid net adds in the prior year. 150,000 of the
prepaid losses in the quarter were basic phones.

Now let's move to our wireline segment on slide 10. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.4% in the quarter due to
ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies in competition, partially offset by growth from our high-quality fiber-based products. Consumer
markets revenue decreased 1.4%, driven by legacy core declines, partially offset by Fios growth. Fios consumer revenue increased by 1.7%, primarily
due to our broadband offerings. In Fios we added 43,000 Internet customers and had video losses of 37,000 in the quarter.

Internet ads were driven by strong demand, as customers value their broadband connection more than ever before. Video results continue to face
macro pressures from cord cutting.

JULY 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Enterprise solutions revenue decreased 4.2% in the quarter, driven by declines in legacy services, partially offset by growth in our fiber-based
products. On a constant currency basis, revenue was down 5.1%. Partner solutions revenue declined 2.8%. The increase in customer demand for
fiber access is a growth opportunity for this business and is mitigating declines in copper-based products.

Within business markets, revenue decreased 7.4%, mainly due to reductions in CPE sales and ongoing headwinds from legacy services. Fiber-based
products continue to grow and are becoming a more significant component of recurring revenue.

Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 19.6%, excluding the impacts of revenue recognition. Price compression on legacy products, secular trends,
and increasing content costs continue to pressure wireline margin performance.

Excluding the impact from revenue recognition, we expect margins to be around 20% for the near term. Let's now move on to slide 11 to discuss
our media and IoT businesses. During the second quarter the Oath team continued to build out and operationalize its content strategy and make
progress towards the integration of ad products into one end-to-end cross-platform and cross-device solution. As we highlighted on our last call,
the video platform became integrated in the first quarter.

During the second quarter, half of the demand-side platform for ad inventory was integrated, and Oath is on track to complete integrating the
remaining components of the platform within the second half of the year. We expect to see momentum build after advertisers and content owners
have the ability to come to us on a single platform. For the second quarter, Oath revenue was $1.9 billion, which was relatively flat on a sequential
basis.

In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue, including Verizon Connect, was up approximately
13%.

Let's now move to slide 12 to summarize our second-quarter results. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, and our business is
well positioned for growth into the future. Consolidated revenue growth was led by wireless service revenue turning positive, inclusive of the
headwinds from revenue recognition.

Our unlimited offerings are evolving to provide a new level of flexibility, enabling people to customize their experience on the nation's best network.
Churn rates remain low, signaling excellent customer satisfaction and retention of the nation's best wireless customer base.

Last year we announced our goal to drive $10 billion in cumulative cash savings throughout the business over a four-year period. Our business
excellence initiative, which includes a zero-based budgeting, is off to a solid start in 2018. It has yielded approximately $500 million of cumulative
cash savings on a year-to-date basis. Most of the incremental cash savings realized in the second quarter were related to network activities and
are reflected in the lower total capital spend. The program remains on track to deliver against our goals over the four-year period.

Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased year over year, driven by the strength of our revenue performance and operational efficiencies
realized across the business. Finally, we are making significant strides in honoring our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet. We substantially
reduced net debt within the quarter, and the business is generating strong cash flows as we prepare for the upcoming launch of 5G.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Hans to discuss our strategic priorities.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Incoming CEO

Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. First let me say that it is a great honor to be named successor to Lowell, and I'm humbled by the
opportunity to lead this great Company. I'm looking forward to being part of leading the digitalization era into the most technologically advanced
market in the world, which will have significant positive impact on consumers, industries, and our society for decades to come.

JULY 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

During my tenure with Verizon, I have been actively involved in setting the strategy and priorities for the Company alongside Lowell, the Board,
and the rest of the leadership team. We have laser focus on execution of the fundamentals. We are positioning the business for future growth,
maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, and driving sustainable financial performance for long-term value creation.

We remain committed to enhancing our network leadership position, strengthening our customer relationships, and driving efficiencies throughout
the business. Verizon has assets in place to develop and provide the most advanced next-generation network, which we call the Verizon Intelligent
Edge Network. We are positioned for growth in the current generation, and we are leading the way to fully capture the significant opportunity that
lies ahead in the transition to the fifth generation of wireless services.

We will continue to be the clear leader in 4G performance, driving further innovation, growth opportunities, and implementing new network
capabilities that will further enhance our customers' experience. We have made the strategic investments in millimeterwave spectrum that enable
ultra-wide band 5G services. Our fiber deployment is progressing well, with buildouts underway in over 50 markets outside of our ILEC footprint
that will allow us to take full advantage of the many use cases that will come to bear in 5G.

Our Intelligent Edge Network design allows us to realize significant efficiencies by utilizing common infrastructure in the core and providing
flexibility at the edge of the network to meet customer requirements. Our Oath and IoT assets will provide a platform for us to participate in the
use cases that 5G will enable.

We are rapidly approaching the launch of our first use case for 5G with the rollout of residential broadband services. As you know, Sacramento and
Los Angeles are two of the four initial commercial launch markets; and you heard Lowell earlier announce Houston a few minutes ago. News and
updates on our fourth market will be provided soon.

Residential broadband is just the first of many use cases for 5G that will be deployed on our multiuse network. Progress is well underway across
all of the use cases, and we remain focused on providing 5G mobility in 2019.

I'm super excited for the future. We are on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution, and we have the assets in place to take full advantage of the
opportunities that lie ahead.

Now I will turn the call back over to Brady so we can get your questions.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you, Hans. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.

Okay, great. Thanks. And Lowell, first I'd like to say congrats on your retirement and your career at Verizon. It's been really -- I've really enjoyed

JULY 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

So Lowell, during your tenure as CEO, you've really -- Verizon has really stuck to its core competency of wireless network leadership while other
companies have moved to diversify into adjacent areas. How confident are you that this is the right path? And as we look ahead to 5G deployment
and adoption, do you believe the Verizon can widen the gap and create a sustainable advantage versus other carriers? Thanks.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Well, thanks, John. I think your strategy is based on the assets that you have in your portfolio and where you think you can go with a high degree
of success. We talk about competing to win. We don't want to play to play; we want to play to win.

And we've looked at the things that we've done -- network leadership is at the core. It's part of the values of the Company. Every individual here is
proud of what we do on network leadership. And we've stayed close to that core. Branching out, though, into things like Verizon Connect and Oath
is a very logical, near progression for us. And we see the advantages that will strengthen the core going forward.

If I look at the things that I'm proudest of, it's the things that you mentioned that we've done, and pushing the envelope on 5G and 4G are some
of those. I also have to say, a little bit with a smile on my face, I'm glad we didn't follow a lot of the things the analysts and the bankers told us we
had to do.

And that has put us in a position now that Matt outlined, where we've got a strong balance sheet; we've got a clear strategy; and I think we are
going to put a significant distance between us and the competition. And the first mover on the network generation changes usually gains a
significant amount of market share, and with the assets that we have, we think we are in that position with 5G.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Great, thanks, Lowell.

Operator

Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Great, thank you. Good morning. And also I wanted to share my best wishes to Lowell -- good luck with your retirement.

Good to hear the news about Houston. You have talked about a 30 million-plus opportunity for the residential broadband. Can you just help us
think about the pacing of that? How are you thinking about the initial timing of the rollout, how many markets we'll see in terms of pops covered
over the next 12, 24 months?

And then on the mobility side, you're starting to talk about that a bit more. We have heard some of your competitors talk about how many markets
they will launch this year. How rapidly do you think you are going to roll that out? And is that all going to be microwave, or are you going to use
some lower bands for the mobility 5G? Thank you. Or millimeterwave.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Incoming CEO

Thank you, Simon. This is Hans. So when it comes to the fixed wireless access, as we have said from the beginning, we will have an initial commercial
launch of four markets this year. That is going to be based on our sort of software that we developed in the beginning, calling TF.

We are preparing the whole network with the Intelligent Edge Network to be ready to launch 5G based on the NR standard that is coming out right
now, and vendors and equipment manufacturers and OEMs are preparing right now. So we will be ready as soon as that has the maturity to be
released to our customers.

So that will come back on -- we will go for the full 30 million households, which is our ambitions that we have explained before. So that's where
we are on the fixed wireless access.

On the mobility, we do the same. Remember the Intelligent Edge Network is a multiuse network, so it's the same radio base station that's going to
provide our fixed wireless access as mobility. So we are -- and as I said before, we are now in deployment on fiber in more than 50 cities.

So we are preparing everything to be ready for the maturity of the equipment and the softwares, as well as having the CPE and handset market
ready for launching those products. And right now that's the ambitions we see in 2019. We have not named the cities, but as you can hear, we are
deploying in 50 markets with fiber. So I think that is an important point of it.

So that is where we are. And we will come back and give you updates all the time on the new things we are doing. And today we are now launching
the third city here in Houston. We are super excited over that. So we will continue to come with the flow of information what we're doing on 5G.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

And when should you launch the first of the Sacramento, LA, Houston? Is that going to be in the third quarter or more likely the fourth?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Incoming CEO

Good question. As we say, we say that in the second half of 2018 -- so we promise we will come out and tell you as soon as we know exactly the
date.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Thank you.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Thanks again. Lowell, congratulations again; and Hans, congratulations. This should be a lot of fun.

Hans, can you talk us through what's happening on the CapEx side to move toward the lower end of the guide? Are you doing less this year than
you expected, or just getting more for it? And where are you in the shift of spending and focus from macro towers to more fiber and small cell?
Thanks.

JULY 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Incoming CEO

Thank you very much. I think this is a great question. Remember, when I came in, we decided -- together with Matt, Lowell, and the whole management
team -- to actually flip the whole network to sort of the horizontal Intelligent Edge Network. And I also explained there were two important factors
where we did that.

One, we wanted to deliver a new type of services based on the horizontal network, and especially the ones coming from 5G. And we want to see
some of them coming up very shortly. The second was that we also can be so much more efficient with new technologies in multipurpose equipment.
At the same time, we put in a new process for capital efficiency that Matt and I are sharing. And I think that's what you are seeing right now.

We are actually doing much more than before when it comes to deployment. And as we say here, we are already deploying 5G things at the moment.
We are preparing all the network for it. So that is embedded in the numbers that you see.

At the same time we also are making a big shift in our whole spending. I mean, if I look what we spent in 2017 in the CapEx and in 2018, it's very
different. So we are also making shift at all time. But this is nothing that we are limiting. We just are more efficient of using our capital, and my
engineering team very happy with the investment that we are doing at the moment.

So I think that we are also -- as you said, we are moving over to much more small cells than making our bigger towers and macrocells. And I will
say, if you go back a couple of years ago, our majority of all our investment was on macro towers; and today the majority is on densification with
smaller cells.

So we have shift dramatically over the years, and I have only been part of it now for more than one year. But I've seen how the engineering team
is responding to the new way of working and setting up the whole new network structure. So, it's -- that's what you see in the figures.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

If I can follow up: anything you can tell us, given that efficiency about where 2019 CapEx might be upward or downward from 2018? Thank you.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, good morning, Phil. It's Matt. So I will take that one.

We will stay consistent with what we've done in the past, where we will talk about 2019 when we get closer to it. But I think we've been pretty
consistent in our commentary that -- look, we expect CapEx to be reasonably consistent, and as we get closer to 2019, we will provide more color
on opportunities to accelerate any spend on 5G as we see it, but it's a little too early in the process to get there yet.

I would just remind you, as Hans said, a lot of the spending that we've been doing around densification supports both 4G and 5G. So the network
really is in a great position to be pre-positioned for us moving into 5G here without it requiring a significant step change in total spend.

We have done this before as we move from one generation of technology to another, and keeping total CapEx spend fairly consistent. And we are
confident we will do that again.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Thanks very much.

Operator

David Barden, Bank of America.

David Barden - Bank of America - Analyst

Thanks for taking the questions. Thanks again, Lowell, and congrats to you, Hans. Matt, could I just ask a couple questions on the finance side?

Just on the lower tax guide, can you talk about the reasons why that is? And is that flowing through to the cash flow side of the equation, and do
we need to address that in the free cash flow number as well?

And then the second one is: could you talk about -- I think as we have done historically -- some of the changes in the union contract forthcoming?
How should we think about that impact on the cost structure? I know you gave us about a 20% margin in the wireline side for this year, but is that
-- did those negotiations give you some window in potentially having some upside in that margin number in the wireline business? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, David. So I will start with the tax question. So as you look at the first half of the year, the ETR was impacted, certainly, by tax reform. But we
had a couple of one-timers in there, especially related to the pension contribution we did in first quarter that you wouldn't see necessarily flow
through to the second half of the year.

So that's why we are guiding towards the lower end of the 24 to 26 range for the year as a whole. In terms of it flowing through to the cash flow, I
would say certainly you should expect cash taxes to be positively impacted this year by tax reform. We didn't have that in the first quarter, because
we had no scheduled payments, as you know. Second quarter we had the first of two scheduled payments for the year, and so started to see those
flow through. Expect to see lower tax rate flow through to our cash tax payments in the rest of the year.

And that's certainly behind the commentary that we gave around the ability to strengthen the balance sheet this year. So expect to continue to
see the benefit from the lower tax rate.

I will let Lowell answer your question around the new union contract.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

David, we are really pleased with the relationship that we have built with the union. During the last contract we get together at the senior level
very frequently; we've been able to deal with some issues that have been thorns in the side for both the union leadership and members as well as
the Company.

So when we decided to attempt to get a contract literally a year ahead of expiration, that was a major change in our relationship. And I would like
to thank the union leadership for the way -- the approach that they took during this.

As far as your financial projections, I would say just continue with the projections that you've seen. We do have increases in contributions and that
sort of thing, but it's not a significant change to the bottom-line trajectory that you've seen, the way it was after our last contract.

The beauty of all of this is now the management and all of our employees can focus on our customers, and deploying 5G, and deploying fiber. And
they can all focus on work and their families and the customer instead of getting ready for a strike. And so we are very, very pleased about this
outcome.

Thanks again, Lowell.

Operator

Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Thanks, and I'd also like to extend my congrats to Lowell for a distinguished career, and to Hans for the opportunity that lies ahead.

I was hoping I could ask about postpaid ARPA. That metric has been under pressure for the last several years, although it has shown a lot of
stabilization recently. And even though you don't break out phone ARPU intrinsically, we all know that it was phone ARPU that was causing that
pressure as subs moved into EIP and, more recently, into the unlimited plans.

It seems like the EIP transition or the unsubsidized transition is fully behind us. I'm not entirely sure where we are in the migration to the new
unlimited plan.

So I guess I was just kind of hoping you could talk through the drivers of postpaid ARPA going forward. Do we still have any headwind on the phone
side? Is that becoming a tailwind? And then, of course, you've highlighted that you are seeing a lot of other devices, including wearables, coming
into your accounts. Are we starting to get to the point where that's becoming a meaningful positive driver on ARPA as well? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Good morning, Brett. Thanks for the question.

So as you look at ARPA, you are right that the transition to the device payment plans is essentially complete. The year-over-year difference in terms
of the percentage of the base on unsubsidized pricing is now in single digits, whereas a year ago it was much more significant. So that shows up
in the ARPA.

The other good thing that is in the ARPA, though, is you continue to see the demand for our products and services. So we continued in the quarter
to have customers step up in terms of the plans they are on, whether that be from a metered plan to unlimited, or even within our unlimited plans
that we offer. And then we continue to see increases in connections per account, whether that be wearables or additional phones on the account.

Those things are coming through to ARPA, and you see the impact there on service revenue overall. So certainly ARPA is stabilizing. And we think
as we continue to offer the right plans to customers, and we continue to give them the opportunities to add additional devices to their plans, that
it's an area where we can continue to help drive revenue growth going forward.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Have you broken out how many of your customers are on unlimited plan? I apologize if I missed that.

We have not. As we said previously, between unlimited and our Verizon 2.0 plans, where customers have the ability to control overage, that had
been significantly above 50%. And certainly the number of customers on unlimited continues to grow, but we haven't broken that out at this point.
But it's becoming, certainly, a larger and larger percentage of the base.

Great. Thanks for taking the question.

Operator

Michael Rollins, Citibank.

Michael Rollins - Citibank - Analyst

Hi, thanks, and also wanted to extend my best wishes to Lowell and congrats to Hans.

Just a couple of topics, if I could. First, on the strategic side, as I listened to the management commentary over the past year, is the underlying goal
for Verizon to become a leading provider of broadband in the home and on the go across the country? And if this is the direction, how long will
this take, and how much can be driven by internal investments versus possible M&A?

And then just one thing on the business trends: postpaid phone growth at the industry level has risen to more than twice the rate of population
growth. Do you have any thoughts on what is driving this change and the sustainability for postpaid phones at this new level of growth? Thanks.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Incoming CEO

So maybe I can start with the network question that you have, then, and broadband. I think when I look into the assets we have -- and I've been
now working here for quite a while -- I really like the assets we have and the ones we are building.

That will give us the opportunity to be a much larger broadband provider -- and I think the announcement that we did today, that we now are
having Houston as well, and we will continue with that communication on the new cities we are going to deploy. And 5G give us that opportunities;
but we need to remember when we talk about 5G, 5G is an access technology. There is so much more you need to do to actually have it.

When I look what we are doing all the way from the data center with fiber, unified transport, multiservice routers, the old way I see that this is a
big undertaking. But we are in the midst of it, and as I have said a couple of times before, I mean, we have been onto this Intelligent Edge Network
right now for quite a while. And we see the benefits and we see the opportunities that it creates.

So you're right; of course, it's going to take time to have it across the country. But as I mentioned, we are already now deploying fiber in 50 cities.
So we will come back and give you more color to it, but I think we are preparing the network to be really using the network and levering the
efficiency in markets. So that's for us a very important piece of it.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

On the postpaid phone, we continue to see consumer demand there. And we believe certainly when we give customers the opportunity to get on
the nation's best network and we have the right price plans, we see good things happen there.

So I can't comment in terms of the industry volumes overall, but we certainly continue to see good consumer demand, and we expect to continue
to have postpaid phone net add growth going forward. And we will see how that plays out across the rest of the industry.

But one other comment I'd just add on the network side is in addition to the broadband piece, as we have talked about the strategy, it's once you
have that piece, what we -- the services that we can provide above that connectivity layer are also very important as we go forward. And we think
we are in a great place to be able to deliver on that too. So hopefully that helps answer your questions, Mike.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Mike, I think I would just add one thing. It's funny; when you are at this point in your career, you get to look back, and you see an awful lot of similar
questions, but just asked in a different way. And I remember when we brought Verizon together back in 1999, and we had about 20% market
penetration on postpaid; and there was no smartphone; and people were saying, well, where is the industry going? You can't possibly get any
more penetration that you've got.

At that point, I pointed to areas like Sweden, Hans's home country, that was at 50% penetration. And we thought, see? We've got all sorts of
headroom. And now we are over 100% penetration. And you see wearables, and with 5G -- Hans mentioned this, and I mentioned it in my opening
remarks -- you are going to see so much more penetration on all of the different business applications that are going to change people's lives.

So I really don't think much about postpay, or smartphones, or any category you want to look at as an opportunity for future growth. There are so
many things that we have literally zero percent penetration in today that are going to be big businesses five years from now.

That is why I am so excited to see the way we are positioned and the leadership team's philosophy around dealing with customer pain points and
providing them the products that they are going to need that will be indispensable five years from now. So that's my perspective on that.

Michael Rollins - Citibank - Analyst

Thanks very much.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson - Analyst

Hi, good morning, and let me join the parade of people saying congratulations to Lowell. Lowell, it really has been a pleasure. And also congratulations
to you, Hans. I look forward to your great success.

Let me ask a strategic question about video, if I could. You've discontinued go90 in the quarter. There have at least been press reports about -- at
least some discussion about how you move forward with Oath, and whether Oath's addressable advertising might actually be more successful
outside the Company instead of inside the Company. I wonder if you could just talk about the role that you see video playing; and now that you've
had some time to play around with some of the different strategies around video and addressable advertising? And then, as part of that, if you
could specifically comment on the situation in the press reports about Oath, that would be helpful.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Yes, so let me deal with those in reverse order there, Craig, and then I will let Hans come in and put a period on it. The questions around Oath -- I
don't know where they are coming from. There's no intention of spinning out Oath in any particular format.

JULY 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We see the synergies that we expected to see, and we see the future that we had hoped for. Matt talked about in his remarks the integration efforts
that are going on. They are on schedule, and so we see no reason to do that. And there is no credible report out there that -- otherwise, in my view.
So I want to be clear about that.

On the video side, look, that is the major driver of traffic that we see on the network today. We only expect that to go up over time. We are not fans
of linear, but I'm not trying to criticize anybody else's strategy here. It's just the fact of the assets that we have and the investments that we want
to make.

It's much better, in our view, to do digital. So we are, as we have always said, skating to where the puck is going. So that's where we are focused.

I was very heartened by our time in Sun Valley two weeks ago. Hans went, and we met with all of the major content providers -- the sports leagues,
healthcare, education, gaming, all of those segments -- and every one of them, when they know what is going on with 5G, and especially the
latency, certainly along with the capacity, but when they see the latency, their eyes light up about what's possible.

So my view is -- and I know Hans shares this; we've developed these strategies together. He has always been one of my go-to guys over the last
five years to see where the industry is going. But it is our belief that we are positioned perfectly to have the partnerships that we need to be
successful. We are not going to be owning content, so we are not going to be competing with other content providers. We are going to be their
best partner from a distribution perspective. And I think that makes great sense for the Company going forward.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Incoming CEO

And I can chime in here. I mean, I've been around now for quite a while, both as leading this, but I've been sitting together with Lowell, the
management team, and the Board on the strategic decision we have done; and I'm fully on board on all of them.

And when I look at the assets we have, I'm really happy with them, and I'm encouraged to see what we can do with them -- both leverage them
and also get more synergies out of all of them. And just talking about Oath, for example, today with the massive competence we have in Oath
when it comes to [AI, MM] -- and we are in the transformation of our network to virtualization -- that is a great synergy and creating a lot of new
possibilities for us.

On the front end, we are constantly working how we can actually leverage our assets on our -- sort of the Verizon side and the Oath side. And we
will continue to find those ways forward.

So I feel good about the assets we have. And I agree with Lowell that we can partner with anyone. And again, we are betting on that we are going
to have the best network, the Intelligent Edge Network. We want to have a great 5G, the best; and of course, we can attract partners that we can
work with.

And I think that is the model that we have and that we can continue to develop. And I see only opportunities when you go to 5G, when you can
both do connectivity platforms and applications, and sort of define where you are going to play in that or where you are going to have partners.
So I'm feeling encouraged about the assets we have and what we can do with them.

JULY 24, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo - Analyst

Great, thanks. Congratulations to both you gentlemen.

Two, if I may. Can I just explore the wireline CapEx component? It was down about $500 million from the first quarter, and yet I hear you are doing
50 fiber cities. Can you talk, Matt, maybe about the -- should we begin to see that wireline portion of that CapEx ramp as this fiber build comes
together? And then, I guess, what does that mean for what I will call traditional wireless spend?

And then just separately, on millimeterwave spectrum, we do have an auction coming up in November. You guys have a lot of spectrum here. Can
you comment on interest, if that might be a part of your focus come the fall?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Jennifer. So on the CapEx side, certainly as you look between first and second quarter, you've got timing in there. But as we build out fiber
-- and as you say, we mentioned the 50 cities outside of the ILEC footprint where we are deploying fiber today -- you will see a blurring of the line
of the CapEx between the segments. Obviously, that fiber build shows up in our wireline segment, but the largest customer for that build is the
wireless piece of the business.

So this is part of densifying the network, pre-positioning the network to not just excel in 4G but also be ready for 5G, especially using millimeterwave
spectrum, as you mentioned. So I would expect to see a continuation of that spend. But the total CapEx number -- as I said earlier, you should see
consistency there.

And what you are seeing is the continued evolution of our CapEx from one generation of technology to the next, and fiber buildout is a key
component of that. So you should expect to see a continuation of those trends, and it's part of the Intelligent Edge Network that will deliver 5G.
And we are excited about it as we go forward. And I will let Hans talk about millimeterwave.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Incoming CEO

Yes. When we think about data usage of our network, we usually talk in a couple of different ways in order to define what we need. First of all, we
have the choice between densifying and deploying on more spectrum. I think that the last round of spectrum we decided to densify, and I think
that is now playing out very well for us.

Secondly, looking toward new type of technology and features coming out in the network that can optimize everything from carrier aggregation,
etc.; and lastly we are, of course, looking to what spectrum we need to have. That is putting us in in a very disciplined way how we use these three
type of assets when we decide what to do in order to have the best return on investment.

Of course, we are looking into any auction that is coming up and seeing how that fits in in that pattern of decision-making with these different
type of auctions. So we will look into that. However, we are also feeling pretty good about the position we have on millimeterwave right now. But
again, we will look into if there are any holes we need to fill in this process. But again, it will be in that discussion all the way from densification,
looking into new features of the technology, and then looking into what spectrum is needed; and then we have the disciplined approach to our
return on investment.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo - Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

Matthew Niknam, Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank - Analyst

Thank you for squeezing me in. Just two, if I could. One on 5G: what are you hearing from your larger commercial and enterprise customers in
terms of demand for specific use cases? I'm wondering if that could facilitate any sort of acceleration in your pace of builds heading into next year.

And then secondly, maybe for Matt: on tax reform, you talked about using the benefits this year at least to strengthen the balance sheet. How
should we think about optimal leverage for the business today? And how do the uses of excess cash and tax reform benefits -- how do they
potentially evolve into 2019? Thanks.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Incoming CEO

Let me start with the 5G and the enterprise. You are right; when we think about the eight different currencies that 5G is going to explore or will
have, I think that enterprise is the receiver of many of them when it comes to latency, security, large throughputs, and all of that. We are in constant
dialogue with our enterprise customers to see how we can build new type of services for them.

And of course, we are building the Intelligent Edge Network. And here we have the definition at the edge -- how we do a specific slice for an
enterprise. And that could be a private 5G network with low latency, or something like that. So we see that as a great opportunity.

There are some features, if I dig a little bit deep on technology, that come out on the next revision of the NR 5G technology, which is on revision
16. That will be even more important for our enterprise customer.

But again, we are building this as we speak. And we have dialogue with all our enterprise customers to see that we are actually innovating together
with them new type of services, where you are sort of doing a real-time enterprise based on wireless, which haven't been done before. So I think
we are very far on our innovation exploration in this area, and I see great opportunities in it.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes. And Matt, on your question around tax reform, and certainly flowing through the cash flow and the capital allocation, look, the capital allocation
-- we've talked about this numerous times, and we are focused on being able to invest in the networks, providing a return to our shareholders. We
know the dividend is important. And we've increased the dividend for 11 years in a row now.

And we have also said we want to strengthen the balance sheet and get back to those pre-Vodafone credit rating profile. Certainly tax reform helps
accelerate our ability to do that. That's our focus for 2018. You saw good progress in the first half of the year -- not just on the debt paydown, but
also, when we say strengthen the balance sheet, we include what we did with the pension contribution as well.

So we're making good progress there. Too early to give specific views on 2019. But certainly, as you know, tax reform will help us get to those
leverage profiles quicker than we would have done otherwise. And look forward to updating you on 2019 when we get closer to it.

Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank - Analyst

Thank you.

Tim Horan, Oppenheimer.

Tim Horan - Oppenheimer - Analyst

Great, guys, and good luck to both of you. Two quick ones.

On Oath, do you still think you are going to be able to use wireless customer data in terms of location and usage to do more targeted advertising?
And if so, kind of the timing on that?

And then secondly, it does seem like wireless and wireline networks are converging. Lowell, just curious -- how do the unions kind of feel about
this? Do you have the flexibility to really converge these networks in a timely basis? Thank you.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Okay, Tim. Thanks for the question. And I would just say to all of you that asked questions today, thank you for your best wishes.

First, on customer data, our hallmark on this, Tim, is transparency. We don't want to use data unless customers know how we are using it. So far
we have been able to do broad data analysis and target our advertising not based on individual customer data, but overall data. I think that
anonymous usage we are very clear with customers about. And it's certainly got a lot of value to the Oath assets.

On the convergence side, we are honoring the contract within the footprint. And we are very open with the union about what we are doing, and
we are very clear that areas that we manage outside of the union contract will stay clean as we go forward.

So we are -- again, transparency is important to us. We think we can do exactly what we need to do without causing any foot faults, and we are
open about it. So we don't view that as a hindrance to our strategy going forward.

Tim Horan - Oppenheimer - Analyst

Thank you.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

That's all the time we have four questions today. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Hans for some closing comments.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Incoming CEO

Thank you, Brady, and I would like to close this call with a few key points as I prepare to start my tenure as the CEO of Verizon.

But I have to start by thanking Lowell for a fantastic journey and fantastic job you have done. And you are going to be here in the transition, and
I'm really grateful for that. And just today like this one, we are in the field here in Houston -- meeting employees, investors; we are meeting partners,
and of course the city -- I think it shows the relationship we have built over the years. And handing that over to me and the team, I think, is enormous.
So I have to chime in to what everybody else has said: it's a fantastic journey you have had, Lowell.

AUGUST 01, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the second quarter of 2019, we reported earnings of $0.95 per share on a GAAP
basis. These reported results include a pretax charge of approximately $1.5 billion related to early debt redemption costs. The impact, after tax,
was approximately $1.1 billion or $0.28 per share, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.23. This represents growth of 2.5% on an adjusted
basis compared to $1.20 a year ago.

Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the second quarter. Consistent with the approach we discussed last
quarter, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition as well
as the adoption of ASC 842 for leases. As we pointed out last quarter, we expect a smaller benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the
adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction in benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to both
reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share. The impact was a $0.03 headwind in the quarter and $0.06 year-to-date. As a reminder,
this headwind is expected to continue until the end of 2020.

At the beginning of this year, we adopted accounting standard ASC 842 for leases, which resulted in a gross-up on the balance sheet for all operating
leases. In addition, the lease standard affects our earnings per share primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs. As highlighted previously,
we expect this to result in a $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter headwind on earnings per share throughout 2019. For the second quarter, this headwind
was $0.01 on the earnings per share. As you can see on the slide, the 2.5% growth in adjusted EPS includes both the impacts from the deferral of
commission expense related to the revenue recognition standard and the adoption of the leasing standard. This highlights the strong underlying
performance of the business. Matt will take you through the details and key drivers later in the call.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Brady, and thanks, everybody for joining this second quarter earnings call. We had a strong second quarter. It was fueled by a very good
wireless service revenue growth as well as a strong EPS -- adjusted EPS growth as well. So I think the team had a good quarter with a lot of focus
on the execution.

At the same time, our operation metrics was good with net additions on the wireless side as well as a very low churn. That, in combination with a
very solid capital allocation, as well as efficiency coming out from our capital allocation process, all in all, summed it up to a very good cash flow.

So if I sum it up very quickly, a very good quarter from us financially. Together with our work in the network, which is so important to us when we're
building our network as a service, we also won all the top third-party measurements. We won from J.D. Power the 23rd consecutive time; when it
comes to RootMetrics, the 12th straight win there as well. So we are really getting the right feedback from the market and the measurements that
is really valuable in this market.

At the same time, we won some more spectrum in the millimeter wave auction, which is now adding up to our portfolio, which means that we
have a portfolio for the 5G era where we can build capacity, and we can build coverage, which we have said all the time. We're going to build the
real 5G with all the 8 currencies that I've talked about before.

We also have launched quite a lot of cities lately adding up, so we are on track for the 30 markets that we have said we will do this year.

At the same time, we continue to add new devices to the portfolio. The latest one was the Inseego MiFi 5G device that we launched recently, and
we have now 4 different devices on 5G.

We're also very focused on the fiber because, ultimately, if you're going to do 5G, you need fiber. Our fiber deployment is now in more than 60
cities, and we had 1,400 route miles a month in average in this quarter, which means that we increased from the first quarter, continued this so
important build for our overall Intelligent Edge Network and for the 5G deployment we're doing.

AUGUST 01, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

When it comes to Verizon 2.0 transformation, one of the proof points is, of course, today that we now are reporting Verizon Consumer Group and
Verizon Business Group as segments in the earnings release that we're doing today.

I can also say that we got a lot of good traction with our customers, especially with enterprise customers with the new support and the new
go-to-market we have, where we can show the full portfolio of Verizon and seeing that we have the right support also for the people in the line
meeting our customers every day.

At the same time, we continue with the network as a service concept, where we have now announced our collaboration with YouTube TV, where
we're going to offer it up both to our Fios customers, but also the wireless customers. Again, working on the model where we outlined earlier this
year how we can partner with some of these content players instead of investing ourselves in it and seeing that we can bring a seamless service
for our customer, but also making it very efficient for ourselves and for our customers.

We also have continued and finalized the Voluntary Separation Program in the quarter, and we have done quite a lot of that. And that, in total now,
puts us up to have a competitive cost base and actually done quite a lot of the changes recently.

So I would say that we are doing this transformation from a position of strength, and I'm really proud of the team that have done all of these changes
and transformation in the last 12 months and delivering these results at the same time. And it really sets us up for continue to be very competitive
in this market and definitely continue to be the leader in this market. So I'm proud of the team and what we're producing this quarter.

By that, I hand it over to Matt to go over the financials more in detail.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a recap of our consolidated operating and financial results. On a reported basis, second
quarter consolidated revenue was $32.1 billion, which was down slightly as compared to the prior year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset
by lower wireless equipment revenue and wireline service revenue. On a year-to-date basis, consolidated revenue is up slightly at 0.4%. We are
maintaining our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage growth for 2019.

On a consolidated basis, second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.7%, which was up from 36.8% in the prior year and includes headwinds
of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the impact of the lease accounting standard that Brady mentioned
earlier.

Adjusted EBITDA increased more than $200 million or 1.8% over the prior year due to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued
improvement in operational efficiencies across the business.

Our business excellence initiatives have realized cumulative cash savings of $4.1 billion since the program started in 2018. We have now completed
all 3 phases of our Voluntary Separation Program and have realized approximately $480 million of expense savings year-to-date. With the last
tranche of employees exiting in late June, we expect additional incremental savings in the third quarter. We remain on track to achieve our goal
of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021.

As Brady mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23, up from $1.20 a year ago. The increase in our earnings per share was
driven by growth of more than $200 million in adjusted EBITDA, slightly offset by a higher tax rate. The higher tax rate resulted in an approximately
$0.01 headwind to adjusted earnings per share. As a reminder, last year's tax rate included certain one-time benefits related to the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, which do not repeat this year. For 2019, our adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to come in at the lower end of the 24% to 26%
range.

Continued wireless service revenue momentum and solid margin performance keep us on track to achieve our guidance of low single-digit
percentage growth in adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. Our expectation of the lease accounting headwind
remains unchanged at approximately $0.04 to $0.08 for full year 2019.

Now let's move on to the review of the new operating segments under Verizon 2.0, starting with consumer on Slide 7. As a reminder, our new
consumer segment encompasses both wireless and wireline products and services targeting retail customers as well as our wireless wholesale
operations.

In the second quarter, total consumer operating revenue was $22.0 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. These results were primarily
driven by continued strong growth in wireless service revenue and Fios service offerings, offset by declines in wireless equipment and legacy
wireline services.

Consumer wireless service revenue increased by 2.5% driven by customer step-ups to unlimited plans and migration within Unlimited to higher-tiered
plans as well as an increase in connections per account. Less than 50% of our customer account base are on unlimited plans.

In the second quarter, consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 8.2% as lower upgrade rates more than offset an increase in phone gross
adds.

Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.2% due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings.

Consumer EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 46.5%, which was up 80 basis points from the prior year. This includes
headwinds of approximately 100 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard, as previously
mentioned.

Let's now turn to Slide 8 and take a closer look at consumer operating metrics. Within consumer, wireless performance is very strong, while operating
in a highly competitive environment. Phone net additions were 73,000 for the quarter as compared to 17,000 last year, including postpaid smartphone
net additions of 209,000, up 17% from the prior year. This was driven by phone gross additions, which were up more than 5% year-over-year.

Postpaid net additions totaled 126,000, including other connected device net additions of 187,000, primarily wearables, offset by tablet net losses
of 134,000. Postpaid phone churn was 0.72%, improved sequentially due to focused retention efforts around our high-value customer base as well
as normal seasonal patterns. This performance was in line with last year's strong results. Our superior network quality and personalized offerings
continue to resonate with our customers. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.97% was up compared to 0.93% last year.

Total postpaid device activations, of which 81% were phones, were down 7.6%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.3%, down from 5.1% a year
ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle.

In the second quarter, prepaid net losses were 213,000 compared to a loss of 236,000 last year. We continue to focus on high-value accounts and
profitability in our retail prepaid wireless offerings.

Fios Internet net additions of 28,000 were driven by continued demand for our high-quality fiber broadband products. Fios Video losses totaled
52,000 as consumers continue to adopt over-the-top video services to replace traditional linear video offerings.

Now let's move to our business segment on Slide 9. Our business segment includes wireless and wireline products and services provided across 4
customer groups: global enterprise; small and medium business; wholesale; and public sector and other, which includes Verizon Connect. Total
operating revenues for the business segment decreased 1.1% in the quarter as growth in wireless services and our high-quality fiber products were
offset by ongoing secular pressure from legacy technologies.

In the quarter, revenue from our business wireless products grew 5.6%, including 6.1% wireless service revenue growth. This strong performance
reflects Verizon's best-in-class network quality, reliability and solutions-based approach with our business customers. Revenue from our wireline
products declined 7.6% in the quarter.

From a customer group perspective, global enterprise and wholesale declined 4.8% and 15.1%, respectively, driven primarily by legacy pricing
pressure and technology shifts. Small and medium business revenue increased 5.4% driven by wireless service and Fios growth, partially offset by

ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services. Public sector and other revenue increased 3.8% as a result of growth in wireless and wireline
products and services.

Business segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 27.3%, which was down 20 basis points compared to the prior year driven by declines in
legacy wireline product revenues. This includes headwinds of approximately 10 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new
lease accounting standard, as previously mentioned.

Now let's move on to Slide 10 to discuss business operating metrics. Business wireless trends remained consistent and strong. Postpaid net adds
were 325,000, which includes 172,000 phones; 90,000 tablets; and 63,000 other connected devices. Phone churn of 0.97% improved sequentially,
while total postpaid churn of 1.21% increased 5 basis points compared to the prior year. Total postpaid device activations were up slightly at 0.6%,
while our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.2%, down from 4.6% in the prior year.

Let's now move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the second quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue is $1.8 billion, which was
down 2.9% versus the prior year, a significant improvement from the 7.2% year-over-year decline reported in the first quarter. Gains in native and
mobile advertising continue to be offset by declines in desktop advertising, though the business continues to build on positive momentum in key
areas.

We are continuing to migrate customers to our recently integrated advertising platforms, simplifying interactions with partners and driving synergies
within the business. We remain focused on growing our audience, engagement and monetization across our super channels, which include sports,
finance, news, entertainment, home and mail. During the quarter, we launched Yahoo Finance Premium and HuffPost Plus, which are subscription
services to enhance the experience of 2 of our most popular media assets.

Let's now move to Slide 12, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we mentioned during our Verizon 2.0 segment
reporting webcast in mid-June, we will be providing overall wireless and wireline results through the remainder of this year. You can find these
results in our supplemental information included on our website. Slide 12 shows a reconciliation from Verizon 2.0 to Verizon 1.0 for both consumer
and business revenue. The waterfall charts show the bridge from consumer revenue to wireless and from business revenue to wireline. The top
chart shows consumer, which had $22.0 billion of revenue in the quarter. The subtraction of consumer wireline removes $3.1 billion, and the
addition of business wireless brings in $3.8 billion, resulting in total wireless revenues of $22.7 billion.

The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from business to wireline revenue. We start with business revenue of $7.8 billion, subtract $3.8
billion of business wireless and $0.2 billion of Verizon Connect and then add $3.1 billion of consumer wireline to ultimately arrive at total wireline
revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter.

Total wireline operating revenues in the quarter declined 4.5%, while wireline margins were 19.3%.

Let's move to Slide 13, which highlights our overall legacy wireless results. Looking at overall wireless results, which includes both consumer and
business wireless, total wireless operating revenue increased 1.0% to $22.7 billion in the second quarter primarily driven by a 3.1% increase in
service revenue. For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect overall wireless service revenue growth to be within the mid-2% to 3% range.

Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 48.2%. This includes headwinds of approximately 100 basis points
primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard, as previously mentioned. Excluding the impact from
the accounting standards, second quarter EBITDA margin was 49.2%, up 140 basis points year-over-year.

Total postpaid net adds were 451,000 in the quarter. This includes phone net adds of 245,000, which were up from 199,000 a year ago. Postpaid
smartphone net additions in the quarter were 420,000. Postpaid phone churn of 0.76% was similar to last year, while total retail postpaid churn of
1.02% was up 5 basis points year-over-year.

For the quarter, we increased customer accounts by 8,000 as compared to a loss of 24,000 in the second quarter of last year.

AUGUST 01, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Total postpaid device activations were down 5.7%. This was driven by an increase in postpaid gross additions of 3.9 million from 3.8 million in the
prior year, offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate of 4.3% from 5.0% a year ago.

Let's now focus on our consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on Slide 14. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled
$15.8 billion, down from $16.4 billion during the prior year. Benefits from operational improvements were offset by higher cash tax payments and
payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program. The one-time benefits realized last year related to tax reform were primarily recognized in
the first half of 2018.

Capital spending for the first half of the year was $8.0 billion, which is up slightly from the prior year. Our capital expenditures continue to support
the growth in data and video traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network,
the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint. We
maintain our full year 2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion. The net results of cash flow from operations and capital spending
is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $7.9 billion.

We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of total gross debt, which is $1.3 billion lower than the prior year. The unsecured debt balance was $102.1
billion, which is lower year-over-year by $3.9 billion and lower sequentially by $1.2 billion. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the
end of the quarter was 2.1x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x and is down from 2.3x last year, reflecting the continued strength of our
balance sheet. We continue to actively manage our debt portfolio to minimize near-term maturities, optimize our overall funding footprint and
lower our cost of capital.

During the quarter, we tendered $4.5 billion of notes that resulted in the pretax charge of $1.5 billion that Brady mentioned earlier. The charge is
predominantly noncash.

Our balance sheet strength provide us with financial flexibility to execute on our strategy. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low
levels, giving us confidence to operate and invest throughout the business cycle.

So in summary, second quarter saw a continuation of our strong performance, while we made the transition to Verizon 2.0. We grew customer
relationships and increased service revenues. The growth in our earnings was driven by operational performance from the business, which also
led to strong cash flow results for the quarter. We continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, and we remain committed to
strengthening our balance sheet.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady, so we can get to your questions.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Matt. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

One short term and one long term, if I may. First, your 2.5% to 3% service revenue growth guide seems very conservative at this point versus the
3.7% in the first half. Are there headwinds in the back half that we should think will get the average down below 3%? And second, Hans, can you

dig more into the 60 market fiber build and help us understand any early progress on in-sourcing backhaul as well as when you will start marketing
that to consumer or business out of region?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Let me start with the wireless service growth and then Matt will come back on that. But I think that the team has really shown a really
good work here in the last couple of quarters since, I would say, we have this new structure. So we're -- I'm confident, we have a good momentum
in our business. Ronan and the team probably have some more chords up their sleeves, thinking how they will continue to compete in this market.
So we think it's -- our -- at least, I have a lot of confidence in the team of Ronan and continue to progress on the service revenue growth that we
have done so far.

On the fiber build, yes, that's a very important build for us, and we have been on for that for quite a while right now. And the speed in this quarter
was 1,400 route miles per month in average in the quarter. Remember, in the first quarter, we talked about 1,000, so definitely we're coming up.
Right now, the majority of the fiber is going to our own sites to go -- if we -- if I may say. But over time, of course, when we roll in later in part of this
year, next year, we're also going to be able to offer that to our enterprise customers and wholesale, et cetera. So that's how we're working right
now, and we're building it in 60 markets because it is just so essential for the whole Intelligent Edge Network. It's so essential for the whole 5G play
that we have to have this fiber. So we have a good speed now. The team has been there on for quite a while. And so it will take a little bit longer
before we can offer it to all our customers. But mainly, I would say, we're -- right now, we're taking to our own sites, which is a very important
improvement for our efficiency. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. So good morning, Phil. So on the service revenue, certainly pleased with the results we've seen in the first half of the year, 3.1% in the second
quarter driven by over 6% in the business segment. So great momentum in the wireless products and services across both segments, as we head
into the second half of the year. We like the momentum we have as we jump off into second half. And we'll wait and see how the back half of the
year plays out in terms of the total service revenue growth. We certainly see a continued path to continue on the service revenue growth that we've
had for over a year or so now.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

And Hans, if I can follow up. The in-sourcing of your backhaul as you take fiber to your sites, has that really begun to start lowering cost? Or are you
not starting to light that up yet?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

We have been starting, but, of course, today, on the total cost that we have, it's not significant yet. But this is all part of the Intelligent Edge Network,
the multipurpose network we're building, and that's what you have seen in our CapEx the last 2 years, the efficiencies. So -- and as you remember,
Kyle talked about that the Intelligence Edge network build is going a couple year more. So we, of course, believe that we have more efficiencies
that will come out within, and one of them is definitely the fiber, which we are now building. That definitely should get us a better owner economics
long term. And also remember that also that this is a growth opportunity for us as well in certain areas.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

This one's for Matt. As you'd shown on Slide 14, you're getting very close to achieving the net unsecured leverage target you outlined at your
Analyst Meeting a couple of months ago. Is it a question that, as you sort of get down the 2 turns of leverage and below, how do you think about
prioritizing the incremental capital you'll be generating at that point? Should we think about that as dry powder for spectrum, which you may be
able to flex up on CapEx a bit? Or are we actually getting closer to a point where share repurchases become a higher and more immediate priority?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So let me start here because this is, of course, something that me and Matt is working with constantly. Remember of what we outlined in February,
we're very clear and disciplined with our capital allocation. Number one into the business, the CapEx, you have seen what we have done with the
CapEx the last couple of years. We do everything we need. And we are on historical levels, and we will continue to be very disciplined there.

Secondly, we want to put our Board in a position to make dividends that we have been working and, lastly, we work with our debt. That's how we
work all the time. So the business, dividend and debt. And we just want to continue this commitment that we made to get into this range. And
remember that was a commitment long before me. But as you know, we are a company that always deliver on the commitments. So that's why it's
important. And ultimately, we will get there. We will get optionality to our Board to have a great conversation on what we're going to do with it.
That's how I see it. And then of course Matt is working with this daily to see that we have the right balance sheet structure and the capital allocation
in the company.

Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. So thanks for those points. And just building maybe on the back end of that. So as you said, Brett, we are as close as we've been to that range
in the past 5-plus years. And so we're making good progress to get there, and that comes from having strong results that drive good cash flow.
And you see the progress we've been able to make.

But just a couple of add-on points to what Hans said that it's a range that we say we want to be in for the long term. That means we don't want to
go past the 1.75 end of that range either, and so get into the range and then be in the range. And then we also don't expect to build up cash on
the balance sheet beyond our normal operating level. So as we get into the range, we look at the opportunities. But our priority #1, which is to
invest in the business and the rest of the items that Hans talked about, we'll then decide the most appropriate use of cash that we may have to
drive long-term value for our shareholders.

Operator

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Hans, I wonder if you could update us a little bit more on your 5G. You talked a bit about opening up the new mobile broadband market. Perhaps,
you can talk about your learnings so far and where we stand on expanding 5G Home. I think you've talked before about new markets later this year
and dynamic spectrum sharing. How is that panning out? And when do we expect to see that hitting the Verizon network?

AUGUST 01, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks. Great questions. So on the 5G, you have seen our progress in the quarter. We have basically now launched 9 markets on the way to get to
the 30 that we have talked about for the full year. You can also see on the 5G Mobility how the improvements has gone extremely fast. I mean,
take a couple of the cities where we basically have doubled the footprint in this since we launched the markets, and that's the pace we're onto. At
the same time, we have gone from roughly having 600 megabits in speed on the handsets, now we're doing easily 1.3, 1.5 and averaging up to 2
gig. What I want to tell you is that the development we're doing on technology is actually extremely fast compared to what I saw in 4G. And
remember, I was part of 4G as well. I mean, we are just a quarter into all these 9 markets. We have launched with all the 3 infrastructure vendors
we have, which means that we are coming out from sort of just scaling in the beginning, getting all the technology to work and now again start
scaling. At the same time, we are now 3 handsets, and we have the Inseego MiFi that we launched, which is sort of a business proposition as well
for 5G. So I think that -- that's what you see. We see a great improvement. But still, it's a lot of the intelligent antenna sort of technology that we're
developing. The team is out in the field every day. So I'm confident that we will continue to do well here. And remember now, in the 5G Ultra
Wideband that we're doing right now, we're doing that in the most dense populated areas where, really, 5G is coming to its rights with a fantastic
sort of the performance there. So that's it.

We then talked about the 5G Home, you're absolutely right when I said that later this year, we're going to launch 5G or 5G Home with the NR
chipset. So that we will come back. There's no changes to those plans. Ultimately, your question about DSS, which is dynamic spectrum sharing,
which is an important piece for anyone that wants to do coverage on 5G, that is still coming in the first half of next year. But in our case, what I said
before, the most important is to get that customer the best experience. We have the best experience on 4G right now. We are just giving them an
extraordinary experience on the Ultra Wideband. We're going to be in the position to give optionality when we turn that on -- then we're going to
turn it on with coverage and capacity when we see it's a benefit for our customers. But I would say the activity level in the engineering team, the
team working on the ground in every city doing the fiber is extremely high in Verizon right now. So I think our focus is absolutely in the right place
to see that our network is the #1. Now remember also what I said previously, the 4G network now continue just to win all the third-party awards.
I mean, RootMetrics, J.D. Power in this quarter, so we're not neglecting that part neither. So you need to think about that when you have a customer
in front of you.

Operator

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

I guess 2, if I could. One for Matt. If we're guiding for the low end of the tax rate for 2019, should we be then thinking that we're kind of steering
our earnings per share growth up? Or are there other things in the mix that we shouldn't be kind of taking that improvement right to the bottom
line? And then the second question would be just with respect to the legacy 1.0 reporting for the business segment. I think one of the surprises
that came out of the AT&T result was the strength that they showed relative to history in the enterprise business. And they talked about price
stability and other things. I think Randall said that this was as good an outlook as he have for that unit for some time. I think that the performance
at Verizon didn't seem to kind of reflect the same strength, but I'm wondering if it had something to do with the reorganization in the quarter and
we should start to see some improvement there. I wonder if you can kind of elaborate a little bit on that.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. I can start with the last question there about the business side of it. And I think that when it comes to what you call the wireline business, I
mean, it was early to be blended, a little bit tougher on the enterprise side. But on the other hand, the governmental and the -- the governmental
business and the small and medium had a good growth for us. So I think we see a very good possibility. We continue to see that with the actual
rates sort of declining in enterprise. We have a great funnel in the enterprise business as well. And remember, I mean, there's no impact of the
reorganization we've done. I mean, I would go the opposite. I will say that, hey, the changes we have done the last 12 months compared to what
we've done the last 5 to 10 years, and we delivered these results in all the units, I think it's a really strength of the company that we are doing a

transformation from a position of strength and -- which would set us up to be even stronger going forward. And of course, Tami and our team are
working daily with our customers. And as I said also in my -- previously, I mean, the excitement from our enterprise customers when we come with
a full portfolio, so be it fiber or UCCaaS or if it's coming with the 4G or 5G solution mobile edge compute, I think we have a good and compelling
story to continue to work harder. So that's how I see the business. Then of course we still have some legacy business declining on the enterprise
side, which we'll have for a couple of quarters right now. Our work is to see that they accelerate all the time.

Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. So David, on the ETR, so as I look at that, remind you that on a year-over-year basis, the adjusted ETR is actually is up, as I mentioned in the
prepared remarks. And it's largely just because of the one-time impacts a year ago from the adoption of the tax reform. So we do see that continuing
to be higher year-over-year. But despite that, the EPS in the quarter was up $0.03, even with some headwind from the ETR on a year-over-year basis
and also approximately $0.04 of headwind on the -- from the accounting standard.

So kind of similar to the first quarter, so good EPS performance year-over-year in both first quarter and second quarter, strong momentum there
for us. We jump off into the second half of the year and so feel good about where we are so far this year. And we'll see how the back end plays out.
But certainly, a very strong platform to be building from.

Operator

The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Two questions. First on the 5G Home, Hans, how should we think about the expansion of the 5G Home footprint once you get the standards-based
equipment? And anything you could tell us on sort of growth in the target market or how your expected subscriber base to grow out? And then
second base -- the second question is on spectrum. Obviously, you guys control less spectrum than your current competitors. And with a
T-Mobile-Sprint deal, we're looking at the combination company with over 300 megahertz of spectrum. Is that a competitive disadvantage for you
at this point? And would that situation worsen with a competitor out there with that much spectrum certainly relative to its smaller subscriber
base?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. On the 5G Home, I think, remember, we have the limited sort of 5G Home in 4 markets right now. And we capped both the development on
our software as well on how many cities. We have that with the proprietary solution. The only thing I can say, our win share is really good in those
markets. There seems to be good appetite for 5G Home. We have a good performance of it. And then we're going for the second half of this year
-- or this part of the year, we're going to come back with NR sort 5G Home CP equipment. And I think that what we're going to do, we need a certain
size of market that -- so it makes sense for us. So I think, as we said before, I mean, this is a 2021, where it's going to have a significant impact on
our revenue. So 2020 is going to be an important year for us. And of course, coming out now in the latter part of this year and starting adding
markets over time will be very important.

On the spectrum side, I mean, I think that we always have the headwind that people don't think we have enough spectrum and all of that. I mean,
what this organization and this engineering team is doing with the spectrum, it is, I would say, is magnificent. And remember, sometimes, when
we talk about spectrum, it's so much more. It is softer, how you plan, how you build the network, how you get utilization out of it. And I think that,
that's -- that the team has done very good all the time. As I said previously, we have a very compelling position when it comes to millimeter wave
for Ultra Wideband, but we also have spectrum where we can deploy 5G. In the other bands, ultimately, 5G is going to be on all bands. And I have

a high confidence that my team is going to be doing that well, continue to have the leadership in the market when it comes to network performance.
There might also come up opportunities all the time where it could be added spectrum. But right now, to launch both capacity and coverage, we
feel confident on the assets we have.

The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

If I may, I just wanted to revisit on the fiber activity. I think you said you're now adding 1,400 miles of fiber route miles every month versus 1,000.
Some power companies has cited some issues with municipalities and power companies and utility. Are you finding that easier lately or harder
because that just seems like a 40% increase monthly is a big jump?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you for the question. I would say this is not an easy work. This is -- but, this is really what Verizon is great at. I mean, we have people all the
way from working with the municipalities, working with engineering, planning, working with the third parties. And remember, in the couple of
years since we have decided to invest together with Corning in the fiber factory, we have come to actually running 1,400 route miles a month. So
yes, you're right. We are scaling right now. And the team is really, really responding to the demands we have on them. We're always going to have
even higher internal demands on them. But as you can see, we definitely have a good roll right now, but that doesn't mean that it's easy to do it.
But I think we have put the machine in place with a team that I have lot of confidence that they can do it.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

And Hans, if I mention, we continue to see that number increase throughout the year as you gain more scale.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Not so much. I think we started getting on the volumes we are, and that's really important to understand because there has been questions on the
market, the CapEx will go up and all of that. Remember, we are almost on the higher sort of volume where we believe we need to lead in order to
serve this market because there are, of course, technicalities of doing it. So I think we have a machine right now that is actually executing very well
on the high volume. There might be some increases, but maybe not so much more. I think now it's more about the broad deployment in all these
markets where we are right now deploying fiber.

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD and U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Couple of questions. First, has there been any recent changes to the cable MVNO deal? And how do you see your role continuing to evolve as a
wholesaler of capacity in the industry? And then secondly, is there an update on any of the potential strategic moves you could make on the wireline
side, whether it's asset optimization or trying to figure out maybe how to proceed in the video business with the current size that you have?

AUGUST 01, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thank you. On the MVNO side, no, there's -- there are no major differences. But the important is that we believe it's good model. Remember,
we outlined our network as a service strategy where we, sometimes, we're doing the connectivity and then we have others being on top of this
MVNO. Sometimes, we do the connectivity to platforms. And in some cases, we do the whole strategy. So I think that, that continue to be important
for us, and we're happy with our partnership with the cable MVNOs, which is part of how we are actually doing a monthly usage of our assets
getting maximum utilization of the investments we're doing. So for us, this is playing straight into the long-term goals as we have -- as a company.

On the wireline optimization, we -- I would say that the biggest assets we have here is, of course, all the infrastructure we have, but also the customer
relations we have, and we are working. Of course, we are looking into all the areas we need to fortify or all the areas we should drop, which was
the market is not demanding. And I think that's a very normal way of reviewing the strategy all the time. And Tami and her team that now has been
in place for this quarter, they are constantly talking to the customer what we need to do and where we need to fortify in some areas where the
products may not be hitting. But it's not major. It is just the daily grinding that you do in order to optimize how you work with your customers and
how you optimize your capital and efficiency. And I can also add, of course, that in this quarter, we announced then that we're going to work with
YouTube TV when it comes to the sort of the linear TV, both for the Fios optionality as well as for the wireless customers. So again, working with
the model that we outlined in February and just continue with that.

Operator

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

I wonder if we could go back to the spectrum question for a second. I understand that the longer-term spectrum position for 5G, you have a lot of
spectrum bands outside of millimeter wave. But there's been a lot of concern in the market of late that for the near term, your coverage map may
be more limited than your competitors until you can start peeling away some of your LTE and 3G committed spectrum bands and dedicate them.
Can you just talk about that issue and how you think about the coverage layer of 5G over the next few years as you make the transition?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Now that's a great question. I think, first of all, DSS, which is dynamic spectrum sharing, is the same for all, and that's a standard solution coming
out in the market of software. So I think that we're not disadvantaged by anyone if we want to deploy our coverage. And I think that's how on --
at the same time, you also want to see that there's enough handsets and things out in the market when you start turning on 5G, so you get --
because we want to do a transformative feeling of what 5G is. We don't want to rebrand them and say it's 5G, and you don't feel the difference.
We already have the best 4G network. And for us, the customer is the most important. So you're right. I mean, I see that we will have a coverage
map whenever it's going to be needed for our customers and there's going to be enough handsets in the market and not disadvantaged for
anything. So I think that, historically, we have had those feedbacks that we are not in the right position with spectrum, et cetera. I come from the
outside. I worked in saying what Verizon has done with spectrum and with new softwares and with the optimizing how you build the networks,
and I'm confident that we have a good path here. I'm not feeling that we're disadvantaged. I feel that we're executing right now. We're launching
markets where others are doing other things.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

Is there any concern that even from a marketing messaging perspective, though, that your competitors will have more ink on the map, so to speak,
early on in 5G even if the experience in 5G may not be all that much better than your 4G networks?

AUGUST 01, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Let's see how that turns out. Because again, that's a lot of promises. I think that Verizon has had -- and I actually inherited a fantastic sort of DNA
in this company that we first do the things and then we start marketing it. And then I think that's what we will continue to do. Other might have
other strategies. So I'm not going into that contest about who is talking most right now. I'm working with a technology team myself weekly to see
that we are doing this right for our customers, and that's the consumer, it's an enterprise customer, it's a governmental customers, it's an IoT
customers. We think it through and that's why we built the Intelligent Edge Network already started 2 years ago. And I think that the significance
of understanding how important that is for the success for Verizon, I think, has not really been understood yet. And we will just continue to execute
on that. But there's going to be a lot of message in the market, and you know it as well. Just be confident that our company, Verizon, will continue
to execute on the real 5G with 8 currencies and seeing that we can actually give the right sort of performance to all our customers in the right
moment.

The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst

Two questions, if I may. First for Matt, I was hoping you could quantify the cost of the VSP plan that was implemented in the second quarter. I think
that didn't seem to have an impact on free cash flow. And then secondly, if you're able to just kind of quantify the savings we could expect from
that as we go into the third quarter. And then my second question has to do with the fiber route miles that you're referencing on the call. I just
wanted to separate the conversation between the route miles and small cells. So I appreciate your adding about 1,400 miles -- route miles per
month in the second quarter. But are you seeing the same momentum in terms of actually getting the small cells put up as well? Because I feel like
you could still be adding the fiber route miles, but not necessarily getting the actual small cells up. And seems like those 2 things would have to
go hand-in-hand, and that might explain why some of other companies that are out there doing the same thing might by seeing delays on the
small cell side.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can start with the fiber, and Matt will respond on the other one.

So the fiber, remember, it's a multiuse fiber, and I have several different customers. I have the network guys that need the 4G and 5G. I have the
enterprise. I have the small and medium. And I have wholesale. And that's, of course, very important when we build that. We can have owner
economics on fiber, and we can build it as we had all those customers. But of course, initially, quite a lot of the fiber is coming and going to the
small cells. And that's why we are able to turn up 9 cities we have done so far. And -- but again, the question earlier was about how much are we
now actually gaining on it. I think this is an early indicator about how we're building the network because you need to start with the fiber and
getting the permits in the cities before you can deploy the 5G. So this is early indication we have a high speed organization to be prepared for the
5G and, whatever, all the use cases we have for fiber.

Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. So Colby, on the voluntary separation, yes, obviously, the income statement charges we took in the fourth quarter of last year. From a cash
flow standpoint, we took for the largest piece was in the first quarter and then some in 2Q and 3Q. Certainly, I think that there's good savings in
the first half of the year. We mentioned like $418 million of positive impact in the first half of the year. And we'll have another step-up in 3Q as the
final tranche of employees came off payroll at the end of June. So for the full year, I expect that to be north of $1 billion of impact, and that benefit
on a year-over-year basis will carry over into the first half of next year until we get to a full run rate by June of next year. So certainly being a positive

thing is part of our overall focus on improving the cost efficiency of the business, and we will continue to focus on that. We're well on track to more
than meet the $10 billion commitment we made, and the VSP was a big component of that.

The next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners.

Michael McCormack - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Telecommunications Senior Analyst

Hans, just a quick comment on what you're seeing at robust subscriber estimate business segment for wireless. What are you seeing from a
competitive standpoint in the B2B marketplace? I know one of your competitors was pretty loud about getting bigger there. And just thinking
about the ARPA drivers going forward. What do you see there? Obviously, you have more room to move to Unlimited. Any other puts and takes
of ARPA should we be thinking about for the back half?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. On the business side, when it comes to wireless, we are taking share. We feel really good about it. I think that Tami and the team are doing a
great job with relationship we had and, of course, with the network quality have come. It's very important for businesses. I mean, there's no doubt
about that coverage and capacity becomes even more important. And there's no enterprise company that has not been bigger to transformation.
So I'm pleased with that. We want to do even more. So yes.

The second question was about the ARPA, and I will hand it over to Matt. But I can also say that the team with Ronan, especially on the consumer
side, has been since the Unlimited was launched, continue to lean forward with new offerings, with new ways of dealing with the market segmenting
it up and, actually, continue to have a good service revenue growth. And I think that's what I'm pleased with, and I look at the team. I know that
they have more chords up their sleeves, as I say. And what Matt and I are doing together, we're transforming the company to have a disciplined
approach to that, to be prepared for that marketplace, to continue to do well. And so I feel good about Ronan and what his team is doing.

Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Mike, as you think about wireless as a whole in the ARPA trajectory, it's coming from the overall growth of the business. Just
a few things to point out that's really driving both ARPA and obviously the total service revenue worth of that being in the B2B space, which had
very strong results in the quarter or the consumer space, which also performed well. Net account growth, positive in second quarter of this year.
That's up year-over-year, so good growth there. We continue to lead the industry in phone gross adds, yet again, a number of quarters in a row
that we've done that. And in addition to leading the industry in gross adds, growing year-over-year and not -- that's something that not all industry
participants can say that they did. So leading the industry in gross adds, also leading the industry in phone churn yet again. The net result there is
phone net adds of 245,000, a nice increase over the 199,000 last year. So as I think about the business in the first half of the year, it had nice strong
performance that went from the operational side on to the financials, as well, puts us in a great place as we jump into the second half of the year
to continue that momentum and feel good about where we are at this point in time.

AUGUST 01, 2019 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q2 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Doug Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD

Just a couple on wireless competition. So Hans, you had seen obviously a strong wireless quarter. I'm curious if you're seeing any competitive
impact from the FirstNet initiative at AT&T. I know -- I think you recently signed a deal with the Massachusetts First Responder. I'm not sure if that
served as a sign of competition going back and forth. And then I was just hoping to revisit bundling and the importance of video to wireless with
AT&T planning to bundle HBO Max when they launch it next spring with wireless services. Is bundling video with wireless, is it lower churn? Or is
it just necessary to compete on a promotional basis with others that are offering video? I'm just sort of curious how that informs your video strategy.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. So you need to speak a little bit when we talk about the consumer and business. But let me say, I mean, if I look in the second quarter, it was
a little bit more competitive than the first quarter when it comes to competition in the market, and that tells a lot about our performance then that
we gained all those net additions. At the same time, we had a low churn. So I think that on the business side, as I said before, we are doing well on
the business side. And again, I think that the wireless part of the business side is important than the network performance, the ease of critical
essence, the coverage and the performance. But of course, there's competition for those deals as well. I think we're doing well in that area, and we
will continue to do well. We have new offerings coming out. And we'll continue to build the network even more robust and getting more quality
on it. So again, I think the team is there. Matt and I are working with the transformation of the company to enable us to continue to compete and
do well in the market and given both Tami, I would say, and Ronan the -- sort of the tools to work in the market. And that's what we're doing. And
I think we have done it well in this quarter and preparing for the rest of the year.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Just one follow-up on the video question there. Look, we're very confident with the most important thing to customers in wireless is the quality
of the network experience. And so for the past couple of years now, we're seeing competitive bundled video offerings in with wireless. And we
continue to lead the industry in phone gross adds. And we continue to lead the industry in churn. So I think that demonstrates the most important
thing to customers, the quality of that connection, the reliability of that connection and that when you have the best network, you don't need to
bundle other things in there in the same way. And we'll continue to be focused on providing the best quality network out there.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Brad, that's all the time we have right now. Before we end the call, I'd like to hand it over to Hans for some closing comments.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady. I think we've covered quite a lot of ground in this quarter because, basically, question has ranged for all our business.

But just a couple of things. First of all, I'm really proud of the team of what they achieved. I mean, remember, we have changed the structure. We
have changed how we build the network. We have done a large voluntary program. We're reporting in new structure. We're putting the new
structure. And the team is executing well. I think that's the way we want to work here, continue to lead the market and continue to transform to
be a strong company with a strategy we set out in February. So then it comes back to execution on fundamentals. That's what we're doing and will
continue to do so, to be disciplined on our capital, also continue to lead to market. And then, of course, I think a lot of questions are circulating
around the 5G. What we laid out in the February Capital Markets Day is still valid, and that's what we are aiming for and we are executing on. And
I think that the team is doing a great job there.

So I think to sum it up, I'm proud of the quarter and the changes we're doing, at the same time delivering this quarter so -- and financial earnings.
So thank you very much for attending this call, and I guess I'll see you out there soon.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.13 per share on a GAAP
basis. Reported results included a pretax loss from special items of approximately $255 million, including a net pretax loss of $102 million related
to early debt redemption costs and a net charge of $153 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities. Excluding the
effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.18 in the second quarter compared to $1.23 a year ago.

Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our second quarter earnings profile. Consistent with the approach we have shown for several
quarters, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition in 2018.
As a reminder, we expect 2020 to be the final year that the adoption of this standard will have a material year-over-year impact on our income
statement.

As we illustrated in previous quarters, we realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 during the second quarter compared to the prior
year primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported
and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.02 for the quarter and $0.05 year-to-date. For full year
2020, we continue to expect the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09.

Matt will go through the COVID impacts that we experienced throughout the quarter in detail in his section. Overall, we estimate that there was a
$0.14 headwind included in the reported and adjusted EPS from COVID during the quarter. In addition, we recognized an aggregate tax benefit of
$156 million in connection with a series of legal entity restructurings related to an internal reorganization, which resulted in a benefit of approximately
$0.04 within our reported and adjusted EPS. While adjusted EPS was down 4.1% in the second quarter as a result of the impact of COVID and ASC
606, we continue to see underlying growth in our operations.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and thank you, everyone, for joining this earnings call. Let me reiterate what I said in the -- after the first quarter. We are in
unprecedented times with multiple crises and a business that we need to run at the same time. I can only say to all of you I'm extremely proud of
how Verizon and our employees have responded to all of it.

I think of this quarter as a quarter where the stakeholder capitalist strategy of Verizon really beared fruit. I have reported many earnings calls in my
life. This quarter comes together with good support of our employees, a great support to our customers when it comes to our network and our
flexibility, a big contribution to our society when it comes to how we are acting and supporting the society in these tough times, but also a very
good and solid financial result for our shareholders. That's a really good sort of ending of the second quarter or the first half of a very unprecedented
year.

We have continued as a leadership team to work in a 3-pronged governance. Part of our team is working with the daily crisis to see that we are
doing the right things and with the right priorities in this pandemic, economical downturn, racial injustice that is ongoing in the country. The
second part is, of course, working business as usual and seeing that we continue to lead and deliver results for all our stakeholders. And finally, the
third prong is to work with what are opportunities created from this pandemic, economical downturn so we come out even stronger as a company
after this, coming out to a new normal.

Our strategy and our underlying strategic priorities has not changed during this time. They have reconfirmed that we are on the right path with
our network-as-a-service and our go-to-market. Many of the things that we outlined in the Verizon 2.0 are really playing a vital role for us being
able to deliver to all our stakeholders, especially to our customers in times like this.

One of the transformations was, of course, to have a purpose-driven company where our employees are very engaged and excited of our future
but also seeing that we're doing the right thing for our society. If I look back on the first half and looking back on our response to the COVID-19, I
think we have done very well. We have decided to prioritize the health and safety of our employees. Not only that, we have also started to return
to office with very safe protocols to see that our employees actually can work in the offices if they wanted to.

But if you then look at our frontline, which never closed and never worked from home, they have continued to innovate. They innovate with
curbside delivery in our stores, Fios in a box, et cetera. And as Matt will later on talk about, we have seen a great uptake on those innovations when
we look into the latter part on the second quarter.

If we then talk about the racial injustice that we have seen in the country the last couple of months, I'm also proud for how we have really brought
that together with our team to discuss this, having a conversation in the company but also with our partners and externally. No one can say we
have done enough, and we just need to continue to do that. At the same time, we have donated money for some of the most important foundation
that can support that transformation.

Finally, I am also proud that we have packaged all our activities that we are doing for our social stakeholders in what we call the Citizen Verizon. I
will not dwell on that today, but it's an important piece of our overall strategy.

In addition to serving our employees and society, we have, of course, also been very focused on executing on our core business and our core
strategies and continued to develop our platform for the network-as-a-service. I'm extremely pleased to report that once again, for the 25th time,
we are winning the award for the best LTE network from J.D. Power. I have to say the engineers in Verizon continue to amaze me, and they will
continue to do so in the future.

Remember, in February, we made some bold statements about our deployment of 5G in 2020, all the way from mobile edge compute, 5G Home
cities, 5x more small cells on 5G and some 60 cities on 5G Ultra Wideband as well as a nationwide coverage on 5G with DSS. I'm happy to report
we're on track on that and in some cases, even ahead of the plan. We have continued to deploy our technology. Our test with DSS is going very
well. And as well, we have launched some of the 60 markets when it comes to mobility and some additional markets on 5G Home. However, you're
going to see that in the second half of this year, we have a lot of new things happening and building on the foundation of the strategy and the
strategic priorities that Verizon has outlined in the last couple of years.

If you then look into the different segments. And first of all, starting with Verizon Consumer Group, in the second quarter, continued to gain
improvements when it comes to the customer loyalty, not only in measurement but also by creating new services. We saw them coming out with
a Verizon credit card in the second quarter, and they continue to gain a lot of accounts based on their Mix & Match and the way we have developed
the ladder with different unlimited offerings. I'm really happy with what Ronan and his team has done, and you're going to see in the financials
and operating numbers that even with the challenges we had, they have performed very well.

If you look at the Verizon Business Group that are in the middle of the transformation, and I have to say, the way they are now dealing with customers
are bearing a lot of fruit. They are progressing well with the transformation, and I'm also happy to report the acquisition we did in the second
quarter of BlueJeans are performing well. And the growth, both on usage and new customers, are continuing to go very well. And I was also happy
last week to announce a large partnership with Airtel, one of the largest carriers in the world, to use BlueJeans for their corporate customers in
India.

Finally on the Verizon Business Group, 5G mobile edge compute, an important piece of our growth strategy. We have said that we're going to have
10 5G mobile edge compute sites this year deployed. And now we also start gearing up our partners. We have announced IBM and we also talked
about SAP as 2 very important application providers that's going to take part on our deployment and that we are collaborating with right now. So
we're creating a lot of excitement around the 5G mobile edge compute and a lot more to come in the second half.

Finally, Verizon Media Group, of course, being impacted by the advertising market coming down. We see them coming back a little bit in June. But
anyhow, they have done also quite a lot of work to see that we continue to create more monthly active users on our owned and operated properties.
And they also made an agreement with Walmart, which is, of course, one of the largest companies on earth to see that they are using Yahoo Mail
as a grocery and purchasing platform.

Finally, our financial team under Matt has continued to do good work on our balance sheet. We are coming out from the quarter with elevated
liquidity. But not only that, we have continued to work well on our net debt, and we have reached credit metrics levels similar to pre-Vodafone
level. So that's really good work by the team.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

If we look into the financials of the second quarter, and Matt will cover that in more length. I only want to say that we had a very good quarter. We
show resilience. Of course, there are challenges in certain customer groups like Verizon Media Group, small and medium businesses, but many
others have actually been performing well.

We also need to remember in the quarter, we have had not all our stores open when it comes to consumers as well as limited sort of visiting hours,
et cetera. However, if you see in the momentum we created on the consumer side, we added 26,000 consumer postpaid accounts this quarter,
which is, I would say, good work compared to what we had lost 1 year ago in the second quarter. We also are on historical lows on our churn. And
all in all, that is giving us a good beat in the Verizon Consumer Group.

Finally, I just want to highlight very strong cash flow. Of course, we have some extraordinary tax items there, but in general, it was a strong cash
flow quarter. And as Matt will talk about with you later, we have not increased our bad debt reserves in the second quarter, and he will also allude
to we have good metrics when it comes to what happened in June compared to the rest of the quarter.

So all in all, I think we have executed well for all our 4 stakeholders in this quarter. And by that, I hand it over to Matt to go through the financials
in more detail.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let me echo what Hans said. The second quarter is unlike any other we have seen, and I'm extremely
proud of our team and our performance. The results demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the agility of our employees to not only adapt
to rapidly changing conditions but to deliver for our customers and communities while also producing strong financial results.

Due to the strength of our business model, we delivered $1.18 of adjusted earnings per share. This includes an estimated net impact due to COVID
of approximately $0.14, primarily driven by impacts to wireless service revenue and lower advertising and search revenues from Verizon Media
Group. While the company's performance year-to-date has been strong, there is still a high degree of uncertainty regarding when and how quickly
the economy will recover. We are confident that we are implementing the right approach to meet demand as consumer and business activity
increases.

Let's begin with the review of our consolidated operating and financial results on Slide 7. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenues
were $30.4 billion, down 5.1%. Results reflected significant declines in wireless equipment revenue, which was down approximately 20% in the
second quarter primarily due to limited in-store engagement and the impact of COVID on customer behavior. As we highlighted in the previous
earnings call, consolidated wireless service revenue was impacted by the commitments Verizon made to waive certain fees and provide additional
data for our customers as well as significant changes in customer roaming activity during the quarter. In addition, we experienced lower advertising
and search revenues within Verizon Media Group as customers scaled back their advertising campaigns.

Including the impacts from COVID, adjusted EBITDA was $11.5 billion as compared to $12.1 billion in the prior year. This is primarily the result of
the wireless service revenue impacts and lower advertising and search revenues. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.9% as compared
to 37.7% in the prior year and includes headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense that Brady discussed
earlier.

Through our Business Excellence program, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $7.2 billion and remain on track to achieve our goal of $10
billion of cumulative cash savings by the end of 2021. We will continue our focus on operational efficiencies even after the current target is achieved.
The current environment provides us with the opportunity to explore additional longer-term business transformation initiatives and related cost
savings.

Let's now turn to our segment results, starting with consumer group on Slide 8. Our consumer team quickly pivoted to adapt to the new environment.
In mid-March, we temporarily closed the majority of company-operated retail stores and transitioned most of our employees to work from home,
including telesales and customer service roles. We optimized our sales channel to drive more activity through online and through telesales while
introducing touchless retail and curbside pickup to streamline the customer experience as we reopened our retail stores.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

People are depending on connectivity now more than ever, and they need reliability and quality of service. And because of that, we are seeing
them increasingly choose Verizon. For the quarter, we increased postpaid customer accounts by 26,000 as compared to a loss of 34,000 in the prior
year, highlighting the momentum in the business and value of the Verizon customer experience. We have seen activity levels increase during the
quarter with an expansion of overall volumes in May and June.

Customer retention is at an all-time high and is both a function of customer activity as well as a testament to the Verizon network performance
and customer experience. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 97,000 for the quarter as compared to 73,000 in the prior year while phone
gross adds were down approximately 26%. We experienced phone churn of 0.51%, an improvement of 21 basis points from a year ago. Our retail
postpaid upgrade rate remained low at 3.9% during the quarter, contributing to the decline in wireless equipment revenue.

Fios Internet net additions of 10,000 were down sequentially and year-over-year as Fios installations were limited during the quarter due to
temporary restrictions put in place on work inside customers' homes. Our team responded with innovative solutions in developing self-installed
capabilities, and beginning in June, we resumed technician in-home visits across our footprint. Fios Video net losses were consistent with previous
quarters as cord-cutting trends continued.

Now let's move to Slide 9 to discuss the consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues were down 4%, primarily driven by a
significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to low activation levels. This decrease was offset partly by growth of 15% in other revenue,
primarily driven by recurring services such as device protection. Wireless service revenue was down 2.7%, primarily driven by declines in roaming,
usage and waived fees that accounted for approximately 320 basis points of pressure in the quarter.

Consumer EBITDA margin was 47.0%, which was up 50 basis points from the prior year and includes approximately 40 basis points of headwind
from the deferral of commission expense. Margins benefited from lower equipment volumes in the quarter though, as a reminder, lower equipment
revenue has a limited impact on consumer EBITDA dollars as the segment primarily operates on a device payment model.

Now let's move to Slide 10 to review the business group results. Reliable and secure connectivity have never been more critical as companies
continue to adapt to new ways to support their employees while simultaneously driving their businesses forward. During the quarter, our business
team responded to the challenges of COVID, handling increased traffic needs while also meeting a surge in demand for connectivity and devices,
particularly from public sector and enterprise clients.

While wireless demand remained high throughout the quarter in public sector, we experienced offsetting pressures in both small and medium
business as well as global enterprise. As a result, segment phone gross adds were down approximately 17% from the prior year, contributing to
postpaid phone net adds of 76,000, down from 171,000 in the year-ago period. Business segment phone churn of 0.90% in the quarter was down
7 basis points year-over-year, driven by strength in public sector.

Let's now move to Slide 11 to review the business financial performance. Total operating revenues for the business segment were down 3.7% from
the prior year. Wireless revenue was down year-over-year due to declines in wireless equipment revenue offset by 3.1% growth in wireless service
revenue primarily driven by small and medium businesses as well as public sector customers. Wireless service revenue growth included approximately
400 basis points of headwinds from lower roaming and usage revenues in the quarter, which are likely to continue in the third quarter.

Suspended lines as a percentage of the base have come off the highs we saw early in the quarter but remain above pre-COVID levels. The likelihood
of these lines to turn into active status is primarily a function of macroeconomic conditions and will be a significant factor in upcoming wireless
service revenue growth rates.

Operating revenues were also impacted by legacy wireline declines. However, global enterprise wireline revenue was nearly flat in the quarter, a
significant improvement, primarily resulting from strong demand for advanced communication services during the pandemic. Business EBITDA
margin in the quarter was 26.2% as compared to 27.3%, which included approximately 20 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission
expense.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss Verizon Media Group. As expected, the economic environment around COVID had a meaningful impact
on both search and advertising performance in the quarter. Total revenue is $1.4 billion, down 24.5% compared to last year, primarily as a result
of COVID-related impacts.

We continue to drive increased customer engagement on our owned and operated properties and saw monthly active users up approximately
4% with strength in both Yahoo! Finance and News, which were up 45% and 25%, respectively. For the quarter, we added 1/3 more client accounts
on our demand side platform compared to the prior year and signed key partnerships with leading content and e-commerce companies. As a
culmination of this strong momentum, Verizon Media won Adweek Readers' Choice: Best of Tech Partner Awards for all 4 nominated categories,
DSP, SSP, ad network video and ad network mobile.

Let's now move to Slide 13 for a quick look at the overall wireless performance. Slide 13 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined
wireless products and services for the consumer and business segments for the second quarter. Total wireless service revenue was down 1.7% over
the prior year, including the headwinds mentioned in both the consumer and business segments. Phone gross adds were down 23.3% while phone
net adds were 173,000 as compared to 244,000 in the prior year. Phone churn was 0.58%, down 18 basis points from the prior year. Additional
details are provided in the financial and operating information and our supplemental earnings release schedules on our website.

Now let's review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on Slide 14. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $23.6 billion,
an increase of $7.7 billion from the prior year. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in the business as well as nonrecurring
items and timing differences. These items include the COVID-related postponements of approximately $2.0 billion of second quarter tax payments
to July 15, the receipts of the previously disclosed $2.2 billion cash tax benefit related to preferred shares in a foreign affiliate sold during the fourth
quarter of last year, improvements in working capital primarily due to lower volumes and payments related to the voluntary separation plan in
2019 that did not repeat this year.

Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $9.9 billion, which was up approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year. At the beginning of the
year, we indicated that we expected capital spending to be more front-end loaded, and we see that in our first half results. Our capital expenditures
further support capacity to traffic growth across our networks while we continue to deploy more fiber and additional cell sites to expand our 5G
rollout. We maintain our full year 2020 CapEx guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion.

The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $13.7 billion, a year-over-year
increase of 74%. Despite the pandemic, our balance sheet was further strengthened in the quarter. We continue to operate with elevated liquidity
levels, which we believe is appropriate in this environment.

During the quarter, we further lowered maturities through year-end 2022 by $3.8 billion with liability management transactions, which also improved
overall portfolio borrowing costs. We now have no unsecured bond maturities for the remainder of this year and less than $1 billion in 2021. Overall
net debt for the quarter decreased sequentially by $5.7 billion. Net unsecured debt totaled $94.4 billion for the quarter, resulting in a net unsecured
debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of about 2.0x, down slightly from last quarter.

Though we are at the high end of our targeted range of 1.75x to 2.0x, we continue to manage our balance sheet under our capital allocation policy.
Our estimate of the leverage ratio Standard & Poor's uses for their credit rating analysis is now less than their boundary for an A- rating. Therefore,
we have now met our commitment to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile.

Let's move on to Slide 15 to take a deeper look at the trends we have seen exiting the second quarter. This slide highlights select key metrics and
year-over-year results for both the full quarter and the month of June. Our various customer groups experienced a wide range of trends in customer
demand during the quarter and exited the period with different trajectories.

As restrictions began to ease during the second quarter, we gradually started reopening our company-operated stores with limited hours and our
new touchless retail approach to further employee and customer safety. At quarter end, more than 60% of our stores were opened, up from roughly
30% in April, and we expect to be close to fully opened by the end of July, conditions permitting. As a result, we exited the quarter with significantly
better levels of consumer activity than at the beginning of the quarter.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Consumer postpaid wireless gross adds declined approximately 21% in June, a material improvement over the decline seen in April. In June,
upgrades were relatively flat versus the prior year given pent-up demand, the availability of more 5G devices and a new lower-priced iPhone.
Despite the increased gross add activity, churn remained historically low in June.

In Fios, we transitioned from an initial period of not performing installations to the introduction of Fios in a box in late April, to having technicians
resume entering customer homes in the beginning of June. And we are constructively working to bring our installation pipeline to normal levels.
This activity led to a significant improvement in Fios Internet gross adds in June, which has carried into July.

In our business group, we have separated results for the different customer groups as they experienced different trends. We continue to see
significant pressures in small and medium business. June gross add declines of approximately 23% for small and medium business were in line
with the impacts experienced at the onset of the pandemic while phone churn was marginally higher. Similar to consumer, upgrade activity was
more robust in June. While we are encouraged by the June trends, we may see ongoing impacts to this cohort.

In April, we highlighted the surge in demand of connectivity within our public sector and certain global enterprise customers. As we exit the quarter,
we continue to see robust demand for both phones and connected devices within the public sector. In global enterprise, we experienced a
year-over-year reduction in wireless volumes beginning in mid-April but exit the quarter with improvement in gross add activity. We remain
committed to serving the needs of these important customers, including all those on the frontline as they continue to adapt to new ways of doing
business.

Throughout the quarter, we made a number of voluntary commitments, most notably participating in the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge,
to ease the impact on consumers and small businesses by waiving various fees, agreeing not to disconnect eligible customers for nonpayment
and providing increased data to metered customers, among other initiatives. The effect of these commitments, along with reductions in roaming
and other usage-based activity, resulted in headwinds on total wireless service revenue in the quarter that were in line with the expectation shared
on our first quarter earnings call.

Ongoing impacts to customer behavior from the pandemic mean that usage-based revenue, including roaming revenue and travel pass, is likely
to be suppressed for some time. And we expect total wireless service revenue in the third quarter to increase sequentially and for the year-over-year
growth rate to improve from the second quarter and be within a range of negative 1% to flat. We are encouraged by the payment trends of
consumers and small businesses that opted into the Keep Americans Connected Pledge, with the majority of these accounts making some payments
while under the pledge and more than 1/3 of such accounts current at the end of the pledge. At this time, we have taken no additional bad debt
reserve.

We continue to monitor payment trends and will reassess as needed. We are working with affected customers and have a long and successful track
record in this area. These customers value the communication services that are vital to their everyday lives, and we value the longevity of these
relationships. To that end, we have enrolled many impacted customers in a repayment program beginning in July, providing extended terms for
past due service and device payments. We believe the vast majority of these accounts can be cured over time but it will heavily depend on the
macroeconomic environment.

As previously mentioned, declines in Verizon Media revenue were consistent with the anticipated range provided in April, although trends improved
in June and were down approximately 19% as compared to the prior year. Advertising is rebounding faster than search, with strength in our owned
and operated properties. Given this trajectory, we anticipate that the revenue decline percentage in Verizon Media will be in the teens in the third
quarter.

Now let's go to Slide 16 to discuss our guidance and outlook for 2020. We are very pleased with the momentum we saw building throughout the
quarter, but I would also note that a fair amount of uncertainty remains in the operating environment particularly as many states now confront
rising COVID cases and some are reimposing restrictions. The second quarter demonstrated our ability to produce strong earnings even in a
challenging operating environment.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

We are maintaining the outlook provided in April for adjusted EPS to be within a range of negative 2% to positive 2% for the full year. It is important
to note that our guidance assumes no significant deterioration to the macroeconomic environment or material changes to our bad debt reserves.
Guidance for other income statement items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate, remain
unchanged from our initial outlook.

As mentioned previously, we are maintaining our full year CapEx guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. At the beginning of the year, we
communicated expectations of CapEx to be front-end loaded in 2020, and that is exactly what we have seen. We continue to have good access to
the supply chain for equipment and related items and remain confident we can achieve our build-out plans for the year.

In summary, I am proud of this team's performance in the second quarter, adapting to unprecedented circumstances while continuing to make
strides moving our business forward. Our balance sheet remains strong and provides us confidence to continue to invest in the business while also
supporting all of our stakeholders.

With that, I'll turn it over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of the year.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. And let me summarize a little bit where I think we stand when we're now entering the second half of 2020. First of all, I think we
are entering with strong fundamentals. We have the network that is performing very well. I talked about the J.D. Power, and the LTE network is
really performing well.

We're entering the second part of 2020 with a growth mindset with a lot of key strategic partnership as well as activities. Our 5G are, of course, of
essence coming into the second half but has already been built in as we are building so much in the first half. The way we have been dealing with
the pandemic and all the other crisis will continue, of course, in the second half. And I think we are coming in with a good foundation, with a strong
brand, but also a strong employee sentiment, how we are actually dealing with the situation.

And as I said before, Matt has prepared the balance sheet for us to be strong when it comes to going into the second half. And if I look into the
second half of 2020, we are, of course, excited for scaling the 5G to nationwide, scaling the Ultra Wideband to over 60 cities, scaling the 5G Home
to more than 10 cities and of course, start monetizing that. That's going to be a key focus for our executive team as well as capturing all the
opportunities especially on the 5G mobile edge compute with our business-to-business applications and the way we're working with our partners
as well as the partners that we have acquired like BlueJeans.

Finally, we also have a lot of customer innovation when it comes to our Mix & Match as well as how we're seeing that our customer can follow us
on the journey all the way from the metered plan up to unlimited plan. And as we've heard previously, the way that Ronan and the Verizon Consumer
Group has been working in the second quarter, we have continued to gain success with our unlimited. Our customers are moving together with
us up the ladder.

And we also continued expanding into new customer groups with Visible, Yahoo Mobile and others. And we are working to see that we are
addressing the full market and the opportunities regardless how the second half will look like in 2020. So all in all, I think we are in a very good
position for executing and leveraging all the things we now have prepared in the last 18 months.

So by that, let me kick it back to Brady for starting the Q&A.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Hans. And just a quick note before we get into Q&A, I just want to remind everybody we're in a quiet period for CBRS given the auction
and the anti-collusion. So the comments we make around spectrum will be very limited.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

With that, Angela, let's get started and take the first question.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Matt, thanks for all the color on the trends in June, very helpful. I wonder if you could unpack the $0.14 of COVID impacts. And how much of that
is sort of particular to Q2 with the Keep America Connected plan? And what elements do you think will continue on into Q3 and beyond?

And related to the outlook, you did talk about some of the SMB pressures, but generally, global enterprise wireline revenues were holding up given
presumably some increased demand for capacity, et cetera. But how are you seeing -- we've seen stories about IT budgets getting cut. Are you
seeing any signs that we may see more pressure on that side in the second half of the year?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can start, and Matt will chip in. I can say that in the quarter, Simon, we have met so many enterprise customers. And yes, there are, of course, some
that are more hit than others that, of course, have their recourse on the IT budget. But the majority of the large enterprises, they feel that this is
the time to digitalize. This is the time to actually use the momentum to be more digital using capabilities all the way from SD-WAN to video
conferencing to 5G mobile edge compute. So I actually see a very good momentum with this type of customers, and I just wanted to chip in there
before Matt comes in and comment to COVID-19 impacts. So Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans. Thank you, Simon, for the question. So $0.14 of impact from COVID in the quarter, the vast majority of that is driven by revenue,
both service revenue within the wireless side of the business, predominantly in consumer, but some in business and then also the impact in Verizon
Media Group. So the service revenue, obviously, there was a couple of major components to that. One is the actions we took, we've talked about
the Keep Americans Connected Pledge; but also the increases to customer data plans, those who aren't on unlimited. We had that during the
course of the quarter as well. And then you had the impact from customer behavior, primarily around roaming.

So when -- as you think about coming into the third quarter, as we said, we expect service revenue to be better in 3Q than it was 2Q, getting closer
to flat on a year-over-year basis versus the negative 1.7%. That's going to come from growing the accounts, growing the net adds that we had
coming through, but also because we don't have all of those things taking place in the third quarter at the moment that we had in 2Q. But we do
also expect customer behavior to continue to reflect what's going on. So we certainly don't expect roaming revenues to be at the levels they would
have been without COVID. That will continue.

And then you mentioned on the business side, especially within SMB, that's a customer group we're paying close attention to in terms of how they
navigate this obviously very difficult environment, working very closely with them. But certainly, there could be some pressure there. But all in all,
the pressures that we saw in the quarter from COVID were as expected. And so we'll have some of those as we continue into Q3 and see some
improvements in other areas as well.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

And so it will be below $0.14, but will still be sort of incurring impacts...

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Well, we'll wait and see how the environment plays out here. But certainly, we can -- some of the things, we'd expect to be a little bit better. As we
mentioned on Verizon Media Group, they were negative 25% in revenue in Q2. We said we expect that to be in the teens in 3Q. That should give
less of an impact there.

Service revenue, we hope we'd see a lower impact, but we'll see how the quarter plays out. Obviously, over the past 30 days or so, we've added a
level of uncertainty to the forward view with everything -- the number of COVID cases around the country. So we'll see how the quarter plays out
here.

Operator

Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

I guess I want to follow up on that answer, Matt. Obviously, at the top line, we're seeing some sequential improvement. The question I think that
people have is, as we start to see the equipment revenue velocity -- or the equipment volume velocity improve in the third quarter, are we going
to see an equal or potentially even offsetting effect on margins as we kind of look ahead?

And then I guess the second question I'd have would be just kind of zooming out a little bit and thinking about the 5G millimeter wave. Obviously,
the critique has been that 5G millimeter wave availability is not that great. Is there any way that you guys can kind of offer some kind of metric or
some kind of KPI on 5G millimeter wave availability in the markets where you put it out so we can kind of measure its growth?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

David, let me start on the millimeter wave discussion about that. So as I said, we are on plan to deploy more than 5x more millimeter wave base
station this year compared to last year. So the footprint will be much broader. And we will be into 60 cities, and those cities will be much more
covered than they were last year.

So -- and we are disclosing that -- usually on a fairly frequent basis, how that map is growing. As you've seen, we have launched fairly few markets
in the first half when it comes to the 60. So you should expect quite a lot of noise from us in the second half, and we're really excited about that.

But you also need to think about our model will also include the nationwide. So think about our model being a millimeter wave that is transformative.
No one is even close to it in the world. Then we will have a national coverage on top of that. And then in the bottom, we have the best 4G network
in the world. I mean I don't think that our customer would be disappointed with that. We build things that are transformative, that are so different
than the others.

So I would be excited for the second year if I would be you. I mean this is time when it's crunch time for Verizon. We have been here -- I've been
talking about this for 1.5 years. I think our customers will be very excited in the second half. Matt?

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So David, your question around equipment volume, certainly, we saw in June an improvement in the volumes across both consumer and
business on the wireless side. But I don't expect that to have a material impact on volumes in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And
that's largely because of the way we do the accounting now and being on the device payment plan model.

So you have -- if you get that increase in equipment revenue, you also get kind of a very similar increase in -- on the expense side. And even any
higher commissions and so on under 606 now get recognized over the expected life of that customer. So the increase in volumes should not be
causing a significant change in the margin, a hit to the margin there that -- as you phrased in the question.

One area where the volumes do maybe have any EPS or EBITDA impact is in especially enterprise and public sector, where you still have some of
those sales on a subsidy model. But overall, the vast majority of our wireless business is now on device payment. And then you get a much closer
matching of the revenues and the expenses. So I'm not expecting to see a significant headwind to the EBITDA in 3Q as volumes pick up.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

And I was hoping we could just follow up again on the outlook for improving wireless service revenue growth in the third quarter. It sounds like
from your comments you're not expecting any further pressures from fees and usage-based revenues. And so I was hoping you could talk about
what's going on with the mix at an ARPA level. Are you seeing customers continuing to upgrade into unlimited plans? Or has that slowed? And
really, what's your outlook for what that pace of upgrading is going to be?

And then you did talk about the efforts you're making to help customers who've had payment issues. Can you give us any update on the number
of accounts who are in some type of payment program? And I think that the thing most people are really interested in is how many customers
have fully stopped making payments at this point in time. And what are your assumptions about how you're going to manage that base in the
third quarter as you structure that outlook?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Matt, I think you are on mute.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

All right. There we go. I forgot to come off mute. So Brett, as you -- thanks for the question. As you think around service revenue, it starts with having
more customers as we come into the third quarter than the second quarter. I mean you saw the 173,000 adds in the quarter and especially the
97,000 in consumer and adding accounts. So that obviously is going to help us sequentially with billing those customers.

You mentioned some of the fees. We'll see how those play out, but certainly, that will be a factor. The usage from a roaming standpoint, we don't
expect to see that get sequentially better as a large part of our roaming revenue is international, and we don't expect either business or personal
travel to be at the levels this year -- it was last year for some time.

So all of those things will play in to service revenue being up sequentially. But it starts from increasing the base of our customers as we've done
for a long time now, and that will continue to be the largest driver. We still have the ability to upgrade customers to unlimited. We made further
progress on doing that during the course of the quarter and now well over 50% of our base on unlimited. There's still opportunity to step more
customers up there as we go forward.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Pivoting to your questions around the customer payments and where we are with the Keep Americans Connected Pledge. Obviously, that pledge
ended as of June 30. We ended at around 1.5 million accounts. It was right in line with our expectations 90 days ago.

I'd tell you what's most encouraging though is what we're seeing in terms of payment patterns from the customers. We have approximately 1/3
of the customers are current as of the end of June. I said in the comments that the vast majority have made some payments during that time period.
I mean it's more than 80% of those customers -- those wireless customers who took the pledge have been making payments. So I am very, very
encouraged by what we've seen, and my expectation is the vast majority of these customers will be customers of ours a year from now.

Operator

Our next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

First, following up on that last comment, Matt. So have you contacted everyone at this point as you've gone through July? And I think I believe
you're on sort of a 60-day cutoff cycle at this point, so you would know by September 1, give or take, who of the pledges is going to come out or
not.

And then for Hans, can you talk about sort of CapEx priorities and maybe how things might shift over the next year, assuming you get more mid-band
spectrum? I know you can't talk too much about spectrum but how may capital spending shift there.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Phil, thank you for the question. So I'll go first on the follow-up question, then Hans can get on to CapEx. So here's what we did at the end of the
quarter. For those customers who weren't current -- as I mentioned, more than 1/3 of them were current. So we saw the customers want to continue
to pay for the service they get from us. We have a well-established process for customers who late pay. We do this every day. We've done it for
years. But what we did for these customers in the Keep Americans Connected Pledge, we rolled them into a program that took whatever balance
they had built up at the end of the pledge and put it to be paid off over a number of months. And so we've applied that to them.

As you said, because of the billing cycle and so on, we won't get to see where they are here for another few weeks. We're watching that closely.
But as I mentioned, we've seen obviously an intent for these customers to continue to pay. We have a great track record of working with customers
and when they have difficult personal circumstances, helping them get back current over time and allowing them to remain customers, and I
expect nothing different with this group of customers in this situation.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. And about the CapEx, I mean, I'm just looking back at 3 years I have been in Verizon. Even though the overall absolute number of CapEx
has been very stable, what is inside is dramatically changed all the time because we, together with our engineering team, is all the time doing the
right priorities, given the assets we have. I mean you think -- 1 year ago, we didn't talk about DSS. But of course, our team was working to prepare
all the networks so we can actually deploy DSS in all the radio base stations we have.

So we constantly are ahead of the game, thinking where -- what is needed to be preparing for the network. So I think -- but right now, our focus is
very much about the commitment we have to our customers when it comes to 5G but also to keeping the best network on 4G. That's where we
have it, and then do that fiber reach.

Those are the priorities, and it will continue. So then in the speculation on future spectrum or something, that's a little bit early to have right now.
But I can tell you my team is always proactively thinking about how to do this network to continue to be the best in America. I mean there's no
debate about that. And I have a high confidence that they will continue to do so when it comes to our CapEx allocation as well.

Operator

The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Maybe a question about wireless competition. Obviously, T-Mobile just did some refreshing of their low-end pricing. Do you guys see this as sort
of something new or aggressive? Or is it just sort of regular course of business?

And then as we look out into the second half, obviously, the industry has been talking about 5G for a while. We sort of had some pent-up demand
given the low upgrades. Do you guys see the launch of the 5G iPhone, which looks like it's been kicked out into the fourth quarter, as a sort of a
big event for the industry and one where -- similar to what happened with the LTE iPhone, an opportunity for Verizon to take share?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, John. First of all, I mean, I think we're as prepared as we can be. I mean we have prepared ourselves with our models when it comes to
Mix & Match on the consumer side. We have taken out costs. We have the best network. I feel very good about the competition.

I mean we have always had competition. This is nothing new. And so I think Ronan and the team, because that's primarily where, I guess, your
question is related to, I think they're well prepared. And as I said, I'm really excited for our second half and what we are doing right now. And we
are prepared for it.

And when it comes to 5G phones from Apple, I cannot comment on that. But of course, it's a big event whenever it comes because the U.S. market
has a very high penetration on IOS. And of course, customers are reluctant to change between the different operating systems. So that's why 5G
from Apple is a very important event. And especially if you have built a network like us, where it's so transformative that so many customers will
be able to feel that transformation and that's different in usage of the network compared to some other networks, that will be not a big difference.
So I'm excited. I think Ronan is super excited for going in the second half and compete. And we have been prepared for this for years. So -- and we
have been doing it for years.

Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Two, if I could. First, as you've done more with service bundling with things like Disney+, can you share some of the results of customers entering
into those bundles and how it's affecting the economics of your customers?

And second, if I go back to when you talked about 5G in the past, you outlined some time frames of when you thought there'd be material financial
contributions to the consumer and business segments. And as we're getting closer to those points in time, I was curious if you can give us an update
on where that stands and maybe some examples of the way that you're anticipating getting that monetization in each of the consumer and business
segments.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Michael. Good questions. On the first one, on the bundling we're doing, I think this is a key differentiator for us. We have been able to
do partnership with the greatest brands that we have on earth and combining that with the best network, the best brand and our distribution.
And as I said several times before, our metrics has proven to be far better than we even initially thought, meaning how many is taking the premium
from the beginning and how many were converting to paying customers.

But not only that, I mean, it tells you a difference when you start comparing to competition. What do you get when you work with Verizon? You
get not only the best network, you get some of the best services that are running at the moment. And I think that's unique for us, and that's why
if you look at our churn numbers, we are record low. I mean, I think that hangs together for us, and we will continue to do so. But we are very picky
who we are choosing. It has to be the right brand. It has to be addressing our full customer base, that they really appreciate it.

So again, the Verizon Consumer Group with the lead of Ronan and all the team, they are working with it daily. And I would say we have many
services that want to join us because they have seen the model panning out in a very good fashion. I mean the examples, you are mentioning
Disney+ or Apple Music, both of them have, I would say, been very successful for both parties, and that's how we see it.

And for the 5G, when it comes to our commitment and what we outlined when it comes to our revenues, we have not changed those. Those are
the same. We are gearing for sort of the consumer part of it, home and mobility, in '21 to see some revenues from there or -- and then in '22 from
the 5G mobile edge compute. But you're going to see much more sort of milestones right now of customers, sites and all the early indicators of
that -- we're heading into that. And that's what we're trying to provide you with.

You see that now we are preparing for that with announcement. I mean if you think about the mobile edge compute, I mean just the last week,
we announced partnership with IBM and with SAP. That's going to be part of the fiber -- the mobile edge compute in order to serve our customers.
So you're going to see that's how we are doing sort of laying out early indicators on that path to revenue that we have outlined both internally as
well as externally.

Operator

Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

Hans, I want to stay with the same theme as the last few questions where we talk about 5G. You've talked a lot about mobile edge compute. But I
wonder if you could just -- sort of 2 things. First, drill down a little bit into the actual use cases for 5G that you're seeing from your, particularly,
business customers that are -- that you think are starting to materialize. And then just -- I wonder if you could just talk about the health of your
customers and I think, in particular, about municipalities and cities and towns for some of those applications where budgets are now very perilous,
but even large enterprises where they're seeing big downturns because of the recession and how much that really affects the likely uptake of 5G
in terms of time lines.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Craig. Good questions. Let me start at the last question, and I'll come back to the other. When we see the customers -- I think that, first
of all, when it comes to our governmental business, as you have seen, that has been really going well for the last few quarters here in the pandemic.
Many of these states, municipalities, of course, need to go to new models of delivering services to the students or to the community at large. And
that's why we have seen -- I mean we just announced yesterday several different states that are now using our services for remote learning, for
example.

JULY 24, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

So there, we see that there is a craving for actually going to digitalization. That's the only way, and that's not a onetime thing. For me, I think it's a
new normal. We're going to see that going over. So I'm really encouraged about that and our strength working with these customers.

Then, of course, there are some advanced customers. I mean you saw also earlier this week, we, together with the Defense Department, are now
doing 5G tests, et cetera. So they're also both advanced, but also -- so there, I feel really good. We have a really good go-to-market. We have great
network, which is the main thing here.

Then on the enterprise side, you're absolutely right. Here you see a divider. I mean, of course, the travel enterprises, the airlines companies, the
restaurants, large enterprises, they, of course, are in furlough and actually trying to reduce their cost as much as possible. But on the other hand,
you have the large enterprise that actually see the change -- see the opportunity right now to transform. I probably do 5 to 7 large enterprises
executive meetings per week right now, discussing how to do the digitalization of these enterprises. And many of them are accelerating the plans
rather than delaying them. Then, of course, we know a lot of infrastructure is already in place on these enterprises, so still it takes time to do it. And
this can be SD-WAN, video conferencing, fiber or whatever. So it's core things we sell today.

Then you come to the 5G mobile edge compute. I think that the use cases we see today is very much real-time decision-making. If that's a big
distribution center, that's going to have 5G-enabled distribution center to actually take real-time decisions. Or if it's a big manufacturing plant,
that's going to use 5G mobile edge compute by wirelessly connecting to all the robotics. We're in many of those cases. And then you also see cases
where sort of IoT devices with 5G will actually enable a new way of delivering a service. And finally, the whole VR and AR for large enterprises, where
you need a low latency on the campus or on the -- in the manufacturing or whatever it might be.

Those are the early cases. Many of them right now are based on low latency. We see it creeping into security because the data can then be contained
with the company, meaning they can actually process and have all the processing and storage at the edge, which means they can keep the data
for themselves. So those 2 capabilities are the first ones. I think in the next, we're going to see enormous bandwidth of enterprise that needs to
send a lot of data to the edge in order to take decisions. But so far, latency and security, that's how the 5G mobile edge compute scenarios are
working out.

And we basically have 2, 3 -- or 2, I would say, industry vertical that are lead customer for us, and we work with them to do the solutions. And
sometimes we're a third party as we don't have all application ourselves. That's how we're working it right now. And I'm encouraged. And of course,
as I said before, acceleration has been seen because all the digitalization and touchless, that is needed going forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim.

Michael McCormack - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Telecommunications Senior Analyst

Hans, maybe just a quick comment again on the enterprise side. So it sounds like you're not seeing any sort of delayed decision-making contracts
that have been in process or still going through.

And then secondly, one of your competitors was talking about 5G as a home broadband replacement, not really being such a great replacement.
Any thoughts around that? And then I guess, does that change any of your view on the importance of Fios going forward?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

On the enterprise, I mean, to some extent, you are right because certain customers are delaying and not doing decisions. Those are usually in
industries that has huge impact from COVID-19. That's extremely clear.

But we work with them anyhow because ultimately, they are going to be our customers when these come out and those industries will flourish.
So we are resilient. We support our customers in good and bad times. And that -- our business model is actually working in good and bad times,
which is really, really good. So that's working.

The comments on 5G Home from people that are not really doing it, of course, I cannot even comment on that. We feel really good about our
model. As we have said before, minimum of 10 5G Home cities. We're going to have the CPE with much better chipset. That's on plan for this second
half. So again, we feel good about it.

Our learnings are deep on building coverage, throughputs and all of that. And the self-install, which I have been talking about now for 1.5 years,
which excites me that our customers should be able to receive the gear, the CPE and be able to install it themselves in a short time frame. It's not
that I'm down to the times that I have envisioned. I want it to be below 1 hour, but we have come far away from the 8 hours we started with. And
compared to fiber installation, where you need to first put it on the agenda, you wait for a couple of weeks, then you have to come there and install
it and it takes hours to do, this is a totally different way. It's transformative. As I said, we are building 5G that's transformative, not the me-too to
my 4G.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Mike. And hey, a special shout out to Mike today. I heard it's his birthday. So happy birthday, Mike.

Michael McCormack - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Telecommunications Senior Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

Our next question comes from Peter Supino of Bernstein.

Peter Supino - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Research Analyst

On 5G Home, wondering, as you look out at the arrival of the high-powered CPE, which I think comes in Q4, what the key unanswered questions
are for you in terms of performance and unit economics that would allow you to speak a bit more clearly about expectations. And I'm curious
whether you think it can scale in 2021.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I think we have answered the majority of the questions when it comes to how we can scale. And there are always things -- I mean we are at the
forefront on technology. We're first in the world doing this, and there's no one even close of thinking like this. So of course, there are challenges.

We as an executive team, we sit down once a month, the whole executive team, reviewing all this with our engineers to be better, all the way from
the installation to the marketing. So I feel that we have a good plan. Of course, there are still things outstanding, and we can do better over time.
But I think we're in a good place to relaunch. When the more powerful CPE is coming, that's what -- that should enable us to go into 2021 with a
better understanding how we can scale it and where we will scale it.

I think one thing that we have learned also is that, of course, fixed wireless access, we think a lot about consumers. But there is an opportunity
clearly when you see this also as a fixed wireless access opportunity for small and medium business, et cetera, that we will start working on later
on.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Peter, it's Matt. Just a couple of follow-ups there. One, remember, you're driving these revenues off of the same network that you're getting 5G
mobility revenues on. So this is the first time we've had that opportunity to drive multiple revenue streams off of the same investment. And so as
we roll out the network, we'll have the opportunity to add more market share. And so we're very excited about that as we head into '21 with the
progress we're making this year.

Operator

Our last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

I have 2 for Matt, if I can. One, just given the various moving parts as it relates to free cash flow and some of the bigger benefits you saw in the
second quarter that were onetime, I was wondering if you can give us some color on what free cash flow could look like for the back half of the
year; more simplistically, whether or not you would expect free cash flow in 2020 to be above or below that of 2019.

And then secondly, as it relates to the upcoming C-band auction, which I know you're not going to talk too much about. But when you think about
how you're going to finance that, do you think, at that point, you'll have enough as it relates to cash on hand and room within your debt financing
to pay for what you will ultimately spend at that auction? Or do you think that there could be a point where you might have to curtail at least
temporarily your level of investment just to ensure that you're able to get the most out of that option that you want to?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Colby. So with regards to the last question, we're certainly excited about the opportunities that come with the C-band auction. One of the
great things about having got the balance sheet in the position that we have is it gives us the opportunity to take advantage of items like that
when they come along. And so I don't think that, as I look at the balance sheet and I look at the auction, that, that will provide any inhibitors to us
either in terms of what we do in the auction or how we invest in the rest of the business.

In terms of the free cash flow for the second quarter, as you say, a couple of items in there. We had the tax benefit from the item that we recognized
in fourth quarter last year. We also had a timing difference of about $2 billion moving just to regular cash payments from second quarter to last
week. But all in all, our cash flow will continue to be strong because we have -- obviously, we have a strong business with a recurring revenue
stream. That will continue into the second half of the year.

Working capital provided benefits in the first half with lower volumes. We'll see how that plays out in the second half of the year. And I think that
will be one of the key determinants of how cash flow looks for the full year on a year-over-year basis. So we'll see how it plays out, but I certainly
expect free cash flow to continue to be strong for the business.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes, great. Thanks, Colby. And with that, I think we're going to wrap up the call. And just want to make sure everybody's safe, and thank you for
everything today. And Angela, back over to you.

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being
recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor,
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman

$1.3 billion related to a pension remeasurement credit as well as a pretax loss of $1.1 billion from early debt redemption costs. Excluding the effects
of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.37 in the second quarter.

In May, we announced an agreement to sell Verizon Media to Apollo Funds with an expected close date in the second half of 2021. Upon the
announcement, certain assets of the Verizon Media business were classified as an asset held for sale. As a result, we no longer depreciate or amortize
these assets, which resulted in a partial quarter benefit of $0.03 per share in the second quarter, and this benefit will continue until the deal closes.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. It is remarkable, the difference a year can make. We're quickly resuming
prepandemic norms. And at Verizon, our network and in-store traffic is almost back to prepandemic volumes, and our office employees are gradually
coming back to office.

Of course, some behaviors are changed permanently. The mass shift toward online activity, speed up timeline of work from home, distance learning,
banking, entertainment, telemedicine, et cetera. All of these societal and behavior shifts have had an impact on the business. And they reaffirm
our Network-as-a-Service strategy and our focus on delivering on our 5 vectors of growth.

Finally, after a year of virtual meetings, I've been spending time in the field with customers and partners, and importantly, with our frontline workers,
who have done such heroic work throughout the past year serving our customers. All in all, we have a very enthusiastic and cautiously optimistic
stakeholder base.

As we conclude the first half of 2021, I have to say I'm extremely proud of the achievements we have made to strengthen Verizon in all aspects. Let
me mention a couple of the milestones.

We strengthened our strategic focus with our divestment of Verizon Media Group, which we believe will close around the end of the quarter. We
invested in the best portion of the C-Band in order to accelerate and amplify our multipurpose Network-as-a-Service model.

We have also improved our 2.0 organizational structure, and we brought in a diverse slate of top leaders. Our finance and treasury team did an
outstanding job of strengthening our balance sheet with low cost of borrowing and maturity for our debt. We also laid out a long-term financial
goal with focus on growth.

All this focus on strategic execution and to deliver profitable growth by our teams have paved the way for a continued great financial performance.
And in the second quarter, we not only generated our strongest earnings on record, we also produced good growth and profitability in all our
units and segments. We demonstrated continued strength in our wireless service revenue growth. And combined with our scale and operational
efficiency, we produced 5.6% adjusted EBITDA growth. Given the strength of our first half results, we are raising our full year guide, and Matt will
provide details later in the call.

When it comes to our operations, our recent investments in our customers through the biggest 5G upgrade promotion and innovative trading,
coupled with a Mix & Match for both wireless and Fios customers, have led to strong performance across both our offerings.

On the network side, we just continue to offer our customers the industry's best network experience. For the 16th consecutive time, RootMetrics
awarded Verizon the best overall network performance. And for the 27th consecutive time, J.D. Power named us the #1 network quality. Our C-Band
build, we're on track to build 7,000 to 8,000 sites by year-end, and we're on plan to launch the first 46 markets. And we are also strengthening our
network by expanding our fixed wireless access reach.

If we look to the traffic in the network, the customer activity is near pre-COVID levels. And as mobility traffic comes back, we have seen millimeter
wave usage increase 290% June year-to-date. And as we continue to deploy millimeter wave sites and we get more device penetration, we expect

these numbers to continue to increase fast and track towards 5% to 10% of traffic in most dense urban areas by year-end. We are making progress
in executing across all our 5 vectors of growth.

On the 5G adoption, approximately 20% of our wireless phone base are now on 5G devices with a majority of them C-Band-capable. In the second
quarter, the step-up rates were very, very healthy, and this reflects value and differentiated experience for our customers. We also had a record
high new accounts that opted for a premium unlimited plan.

The next-generation business application, we launched the first commercial available private fiber network solution in the U.S. It's an on-site private
5G that brings on-premise 5G capabilities to large enterprises and public sector customers. The team in Verizon Business Group continued to make
very important partnerships. And one of them in the quarter was with Mastercard, where we will work together with Mastercard on 5G mobile
edge compute, transforming the contactless payment for consumer as well as small and medium-sized businesses.

The customer differentiation that we continue to develop further strengthened in the quarter when new content and experience to our Mix &
Match platform with the broken device trade-in, the biggest upgrade ever promotion, and we also added through partnership, content with Apple
Arcade and Google Play Pass.

Expansion into new markets. We have been focusing and continue to have broadband nationwide. And we expanded our 5G Home services, which
is now available across 47 markets. On the 4G Home, we expanded to more suburban and urban areas and is now available in parts of all 50 states.
At the same time, we launched a new home router, which is compatible with the C-Band. Finally, we have recently expanded our 5G Business
Internet also to parts of 42 cities.

In summary, our strategy is working and is more relevant than ever, driving value for our investors and to our customers and society as they embrace
new ways of living and working. We have great momentum on all 5 vectors of growth, delivering on profitable growth with alignment to our
long-term growth targets.

With that, I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss the financial results.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were exceptional, both financially and operationally. We continue to execute
on our strategy, driving contributions from all 5 growth vectors. We attracted new customers and accounts and delivered low churn amid strong
upgrade activity, all of which serves to accelerate 5G adoption in advance of our C-Band deployment later this year.

Accelerating volumes contributed to another quarter of strong sequential wireless service revenue growth, building off our industry-leading
performance in recent quarters. At the same time, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results.

Let's go through the details beginning on Slide 6. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $33.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year.
Service and other revenue rose 5.7% driven by strength in Wireless, Fios and Media. Equipment revenue rose 47.6% year-over-year, given COVID
impacted sales a year ago and was up more than 17% from second quarter 2019 levels driven by healthy upgrade activity.

Total wireless service revenues were up 5.9% year-over-year and 4.0% compared to second quarter 2019. The results represent sequential growth
of $139 million, nearly double our industry-leading sequential growth reported in the first quarter. Total Fios revenues were up 5.4% year-over-year
driven by continued broadband subscriber growth.

Adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion grew 5.6% over the prior year, in line with our service and other revenue growth despite absorbing approximately
$60 million of incremental tower lease costs related to the updated agreements to accelerate the deployment of our C-Band spectrum. As Brady
and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.37, the best on record. The execution of our strategy is translating to record
earnings results, and we are well positioned to continue the momentum into the second half of the year.

JULY 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. Momentum built throughout the quarter, and we timed our
promotions to take full advantage of the economic recovery and increased customer activity. The result was one of our strongest net new wireless
account quarters.

With stores fully opened and consumer behavior closer to prepandemic levels, we delivered 1.7 million postpaid phone gross adds in the quarter,
up from 1.2 million in second quarter 2020 and almost identical to 2019 levels. Phone churn of 0.65% remained favorable throughout the quarter
and benefited from new offers in the marketplace. This result was a record low for a non-COVID-impacted quarter. As a result, phone net adds of
197,000 were our best second quarter for Consumer.

The response to our differentiated customer proposition, including the broken device trade-in and the biggest upgrade ever promotion, was terrific.
Device upgrades, which were significantly higher compared to both second quarter 2020 and 2019, drove 5G adoption and step-ups to premium
unlimited plans, a strong indicator that our strategy is working. We exited the second quarter with approximately 20% of our phone base using
5G-capable devices with the vast majority supporting C-Band.

In addition, step-up rates were historically high, and nearly 60% of new accounts opted for a premium unlimited plan, a record high. At quarter
end, approximately 69% of our account base was on unlimited plans with nearly 27% of our account base on premium unlimited plans.

The quality and reliability of our Fios service, combined with the simplicity of our Mix & Match offerings, continues to drive strong demand for
broadband. Fios Internet net adds totaled 92,000 in the quarter, supported by strong customer retention. And our Fios Internet customer base is
more than 7% higher than a year ago. Our trailing 12-month total Fios Internet net add performance is the highest since 2015.

Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. The improved customer activity translated to impressive top line trends.
Total revenue for the quarter grew 11.2% year-over-year and was also 6.7% higher versus second quarter 2019. Equipment revenue was the biggest
driver, rebounding above pre-COVID levels from higher activations, aided by our customer value proposition.

Wireless service revenue momentum translated to 5.4% year-over-year growth and 2.5% growth compared to second quarter 2019. Service revenue
was driven by customer growth, step-ups, products such as content as well as reseller and prepaid. This growth comes despite minimal contributions
from international roaming, which we expect should provide a further uptick to growth in future quarters.

Momentum in Fios continues with revenues of $2.9 billion, surpassing pre-COVID levels, driven by the continued uptake of gigabit speeds. The
results represent our highest revenue results ever. We remain encouraged by the continued margin improvement within Fios driven by the adoption
of Mix & Match plans and a greater contribution from broadband. Consumer segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 4.9% over 2020, representing
an EBITDA margin of 44.3%, down from the prior year primarily resulting from higher activations.

Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Business wireless activity was highlighted by postpaid gross adds of 1.2 million, up 6.3% over
second quarter 2020 and up 2.1% over second quarter 2019. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.07%, up 17 basis points year-over-year, reflecting
elevated disconnects from COVID-related purchases in 2020, particularly within the education vertical of public sector. As schools plan for more
in-person learning this fall, we expect disconnects to remain elevated in public sector in the third quarter.

Despite the disconnect pressures, phone net adds were strong at 78,000, with improving trends in both SMB and enterprise, both of which posted
their strongest phone net adds in over a year, offsetting the disconnects in public sector.

Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. The Business segment delivered strong top line growth with total revenue
up 3.7% year-over-year. Equipment revenue, which is up approximately 47%, was the primary driver of the increase.

Wireless service revenue growth of 8.0% was driven by strong momentum in small and medium business and the first quarter of enterprise growth
since the onset of the pandemic. Public sector continued to show strong growth over 2020, though it was pressured by COVID-related churn in
education. The wireless strength was partially offset by declines in Business wireline, which returned to a more normal trajectory after elevated
COVID-related demand.

Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% in the quarter, down approximately 210 basis points year-over-year, mostly driven by higher equipment
volumes and wireline pressure. While pressures likely persist in the near term, the economic reopening, business transformation initiatives and 5G
for enterprise provide opportunities to drive margin.

Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued its recent trends and delivered strong performance
driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion,
up approximately 50% from a year ago and up 13% from second quarter 2019.

Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2021 totaled $20.4 billion compared with
$23.6 billion from the prior year. The change was primarily driven by higher cash taxes and higher working capital requirements due to greater
volumes.

The cash tax impact was a result of a one-time benefit received in the second quarter of 2020 as well as a COVID-related postponement of payments
in the year-ago period. These expected headwinds were offset by our strong operational results.

Capital spending for the first half of 2021 totaled $8.7 billion as we continued to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding
the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $160 million in the first half, and we have placed orders
for approximately $1.4 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously provided $2 billion to
$3 billion range for the year.

The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $11.7 billion. During the quarter,
we began to normalize our cash balance closer to the prepandemic levels given the macro environment, and we ended the period with $4.8 billion
of cash on the balance sheet, a sequential change of $5.4 billion.

We exited the quarter with unsecured debt of $141.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $6 billion as we continue to focus on optimizing our
debt footprint. Our total borrowing costs in the second quarter were $1.4 billion, which was relatively flat to second quarter 2019 levels despite
having approximately $40 billion in additional debt this year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the first half was $136.8 billion, and our net unsecured
debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9x.

Now let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. Our strong first half performance and the momentum in our business gives us the
confidence to raise guidance. Please note that the updated guidance reflects the planning assumption that the Verizon Media sale closes at the
end of the third quarter.

Starting with revenue. We are raising our wireless service revenue growth outlook to 3.5% to 4%, up from the prior 3% plus. The drivers of the
revised outlook are broad-based and include positive trends we are seeing for customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services
such as cloud and content as well as prepaid and reseller growth.

The anticipated timing of the Verizon Media sale means we would not recognize any revenue from that business in the fourth quarter. As a result,
service and other revenue is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with 2020, and we are withdrawing that growth guidance at this time.

Turning to earnings. We now expect an adjusted EPS range of $5.25 to $5.35, up from the prior range of $5 to $5.15. The increase is driven by the
improved wireless service revenue outlook, the aforementioned Media D&A benefit and a reduction in the expected interest expense related to
the C-Band investment. Our guidance for the effective tax rate and CapEx are unchanged.

In summary, we're competing effectively and delivering strong volumes, growing accounts, driving healthy step-ups and positioning our base to
capitalize long term as we grow 5G adoption. Our customer performance has led to quality financial results as demonstrated by the sequential
wireless service revenue growth while also flowing to the bottom line with best on record adjusted EPS. We enter the second half with a lot of
momentum, and I am confident we will continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results throughout the
remainder of the year.

With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of 2021.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. At our Investor Day, we laid out commitments for 2021 and beyond to scale our Network-as-a-Service strategy and generate
GDP-plus growth. We made transformative investment over the last 12 months through acquisitions, divestiture and customer innovation and
creating a strong platform for growth in the second half of 2021 and beyond.

Our priorities for the second half continue to build on our current network and customer initiatives to further amplify and accelerate 5G adoption,
further cement our network leadership through industry-leading millimeter wave and C-Band assets. We expect to close our TracFone and VMG
transaction later this year, increasing our focus on what we do best and bringing innovation and best-in-class customer experience to the value
segment and overall, drive growth across our 5 vectors with discipline and customer-focused execution. At the end, the great transforming first
half, we competed very well in the marketplace. And we're very confident and excited on our opportunities ahead.

With that, I turn it over to Brady for the Q&A.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

And 2, if you don't mind. First, I just wanted to go back to some of the color Matt was giving on the improved outlook for wireless service revenue
growth this year. At the high end, that's actually a pretty significant improvement. I know you outlined a number of things that were behind it. But
I was hoping you can maybe just dig into that a bit more. I'm particularly interested in what you're doing to outperform as it relates to plan mix.
And then are you seeing a return of any of the fees that had come out of the run rate last year? Is that something you've seen already? Or is that
embedded in the outlook?

And then just on the improved EPS guidance, if we just sort of look at the $0.03 benefit you got from moving away from the D&A in Media in the
recent quarter, that would imply that the improvement to your outlook this year maybe capture $0.07, $0.08 just from that accounting shift with
the rest of it being operational. But if it's more nuanced than that, I think we'd all appreciate that insight.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can just start, and Matt will fill in. But I think that on the service revenue, I think you have seen the last 4 quarters right now, I mean, how the team
has done a fantastic job to differentiate our offerings all the way to see that our customers are doing step-ups. They are taking the unlimited
premium. And as Matt said, I mean, 60% of the new accounts in the quarter was taking unlimited premium, and the penetration of 5G is happening.

JULY 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

So we just continue the team with Ronan on the Consumer side, if we talk about that, they have this model, we have had it for several years, where
we do the Mix & Match. We have a differentiation, and it's clearly resonating in the market. And at the same time, we see, of course, the economy
coming back. The stores are getting almost back to prepandemic.

So all in all, it's a good timing for us, and that's also why we feel good about our guidance and how the service revenue grow -- growing. And
remember, we are always focused on profitable growth. That's what the team is doing.

And if Matt and I see opportunities, we support the team to do it. But as long as it's going to be a profitable growth. And that's what we are seeing
right now with all the momentum in the market. The team is taking advantage of that, and that also translates back to the guidance. But all in all,
I would say this is our strategy we've been having for a couple of years and has been very successful. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans, and thanks for the question, Brett. So starting with the question about wireless service revenue growth. And as Hans mentioned,
it's really building on the momentum that we've seen in the first half of the year, the continue -- continuation of the sequential service revenue
growth. We saw that the prior couple of quarters. We saw that increase even further in the second quarter. We expect that trend to continue as we
get into the second half of the year because of the operational momentum that Hans mentioned, more step-ups to higher-priced plans, et cetera,
et cetera.

In terms of the fees, obviously, the year-over-year component is rather unique this time as second quarter last year was the most heavily impacted
by COVID. And more specifically, for us, of course, we had the Keep Americans Connected Pledge that was in place for all of the second quarter
that, as you said, impacted some of the fees. As you think about the numbers this year, a good chunk of those are back in. We're more at a BAU
level.

A couple of items, though, that aren't in the numbers yet. Obviously, international travel is not back to anywhere close to prepandemic levels. I
don't expect that to be there for the balance of this year. Expect -- hope there will be a tailwind as we get into next year, but the guide doesn't
make any assumption about an acceleration of a return of those fees in the second half of '21.

One other thing I'd draw attention to as well when you look at our numbers and you think about return of fees, one of the things that's been very
strong in the first half of the year is customer payment patterns, which is a great thing to see. And certainly, with all the stimulus payments out
there, there's a lot of money in the system, and customers are actually paying more frequently.

So even though we're back to normal in terms of things like late fees, we're actually charging significantly less than we were in second quarter of
'19 because more of our customers are paying on time at this point, which is certainly a trend that we're very happy to see. So some of the fees are
back, but not all of them are back when you think about it. And we're not assuming they'll be back in the -- for the balance of the year.

The guide is based off of the strong operational momentum in the business, customers stepping up to those higher-priced plans. And we see that
momentum continuing.

Your second question about the EPS guidance. And obviously, glad to be able to raise the guidance. That's based off having a very healthy business
that is performing exceptionally well. As you mentioned, some of the upside to the guidance comes from the Media depreciation and amortization,
probably about $0.06 to $0.08, depending on the timing of the close. But the majority of it is coming from cash items, whether that be the wireless
service revenue guide we were just discussing but also related to improved expectation around cash interest expense, lower than anticipated at
the start of the year.

So most of the guide is driven by cash-related items. And that's, of course, based off the strong momentum you see in the business, both operationally
and financially.

The next question is from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Just a question on the upgrade rate. Obviously, it's up, not just year-over-year, but even over the '19 levels. Do you expect that trend to continue
and maybe even accelerate as we move into the second half of the year?

And then if you could comment on the impact on margins, I would imagine that it helps incentivize people to move into those higher-priced
premium plans, but the higher mix of equipment revenues may put pressure on margin. So just how you foresee the sort of margin trends in the
second half as these volumes build would be great.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, as I said before, I mean, we have this formula right now that we had for -- since we launched unlimited, with both Mix & Match and
then our value proposition that we have done. And you saw in the second quarter that now we added also gaming with good traction with both
Google and Apple gamings. And this is a unique model for us. At the same time, of course, we have excitement around 5G, what we have, and our
network is performing extremely well.

So I think that our team, they have a very, very good model for continuing this. And I think I said it in the first quarter, there will come more of this
value proposition and differentiation. And yes, it came. We went into gaming.

So I say it again. I have a lot of confidence in the team and Ronan's team to continue to come up with things that our customer loves and using
our distribution, our network and the brand to continue to grow this. And then, and that is the whole strategy.

And remember the 5 vectors of growth, we are playing all 5 of them. And that's why we're also confident of our long-term guidance are done, and
you see part of that in this quarter, that we already are executing on all of these vectors.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

John, so as you mentioned, obviously, the higher mix of equipment revenues shows up in the margin percentage. But I think you also have to look
at the margin dollars, which were up sequentially and also up significantly year-over-year. So very happy with that performance at the margin line.

As you say, once we -- when we have a higher equipment revenue, it has an impact on the margin. But I like the combination of volumes and margin
that we had in the second quarter. As we head to the second half of the year, with the outline of our -- the offers we have in place that Hans
mentioned, combined with new devices coming into the market as we get closer to 5G launch, the underlying strength in the economy, I would
expect that we will see good equipment volumes in the second half of the year. And I would also expect to see good EBITDA dollars in the second
half of the year to go along with that.

The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Two, if I can. Consumer wireless broadbands were strong. Did home broadband drive that? And how many home 4G, 5G customers do you have
now?

And second, a lot happening in MVNO land these days with Boost going after AT&T after they couldn't -- cable away last year. Did you look at that
deal? How do you think about the potential for new competition from all these channels?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks. When it comes to broadband in general, I will start with our vision, as we have outlined, we want to be nationwide broadband provider.
And we're going to use access technology that is best suited for our customers in the mix of everything from fiber to 4G to 5G, millimeter wave,
C-Band and all of that. And this quarter, so we open up even more opportunities for that.

We open more 5G Home markets. We open more 4G Home markets. And then, of course, as Matt outlined as well, we took more Fios subscribers
than ever in the last 3, 4 quarters.

So this is playing out well for us. We're opening up all of that. We are very excited about what's going to happen in the second half with the new
CPE that has C-Band as well. So we executed everything we said we should do in the Investor Day in the second quarter, and we look forward to
the second half of this year. And we will continue to report out what we're doing.

The second question, I think that, I mean, we are open for business, but we don't comment on any particular deals in the market or something like
that. But we are happy with the customers we have on our MVNO.

Operator

The next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Just a quick one on TracFone, you said closing in the second half of the year. Any more color on the process or more timing expectations would
be great.

And then on the C-Band, I think you said previously, you wanted to deploy about 7,000 to 8,000 towers later this year. I see you reiterated the CapEx
guide. But any color on getting the equipment supply chain and the ability to hit those targets in terms of rolling out? And any updates to your
longer-term targets of 175 million on C-Band, how are you thinking beyond that?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So on the TracFone, I think nothing has changed since we outlined or we proposed the acquisition. It's tracking according to plan with the process
that we need to go through. The team is responding to all the questions we have. So it's going to be in the latter part of the second half of the 2021
as we thought all the time. So nothing strange. It's actually on track, but that's where we are. Second question was...

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

C-Band.

JULY 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

C-Band, yes, the 7,000 to 8,000 sites. Yes, we can definitely say we're on track. When we reported the first quarter, we had just started everything.
Now we feel we have a full funnel in the supply chain. We -- the guys in our supply chain done a great job with our partners. We have all the gears
we need to deploy the 7,000 to 8,000 and then our team executing very well. So we feel very good about being able to have 7,000 to 8,000 sites
up by year-end.

And when it comes to the long term, I mean, we have the same ambitions as before. We haven't changed those, and we continue to execute. So
we will do it as fast as we can, given the different type of milestones that are involved in the spectrum. But as so far, we are executing on that plan,
and we are on or ahead of the plan of executing right now for the end of the year.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Simon, one other data point for you. The vast majority of the radios that we need to turn on those 7,000 to 8,000 sites are already sitting in our
warehouses. So the supply chain is robust, working very well with our partners. And obviously, a lot of work still to do. But the network team, from
where we were in March after we came out of the auction to where we are today, they did have plans in place, and they're executing strongly
against it. So...

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

And the spectrum clearing is working okay?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Spectrum clearing is also on track. I mean we stay close with the folks doing -- everything we hear from them is that's completely on track as well.

Operator

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

In the first quarter, you guys talked about how the second half of the year would be an improvement for Verizon in the Consumer business. We've
seen, obviously, some of the new promotions come out. Margins have drifted down to the 44% range.

Does Ronan have permission from you, Hans, to take that down further if you see some more gains opportunistically in the second half with either
the current kind of 5G handset upgrade promotions or new stuff coming down the pipe?

And then the second question is, consumer cost of service has been up pretty significantly for the last couple of quarters relative to the past year.
Is that related to C-Band prepositioning? Or is there something else going on? And what's the outlook for that?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

When it comes to the Consumer group, and Matt explained a little bit why the margin is lower because the hardware part of it is included there.
And we think that's a -- it's a good sign of what's happening in the market.

JULY 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

I would say that, I mean, we constantly think about profitable growth, and that has been our strategy as long as I have been here. And Ronan and
team, they think about that. But of course, if they see an opportunity, as we saw when the traffic came back in the stores and the economy is coming
back, we did some offerings in this quarter, which was good timing. And we will continue to support Ronan where we see he has a good solution
for the market and our customer going to love it.

I can tell you, our differentiation is really resonating with the market, and that's what you see in the second quarter. And we will come back and
see if there's something he wants to do in the second half. But clearly, we're focused on profitable growth, and we want to have -- we are writing
high-quality business in high quantity. That's what we want to do. And I think you see that coming through in these results.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So just adding to that, Hans. So obviously, the margin percent will be impacted by the volumes. We saw good volumes in the second quarter.
But what -- as Hans said, what we're focused on is if you also look in there, sequential service revenue growth continue to lead the industry in that
because not all net adds are created equal. And that also coming with EBITDA dollars increasing.

So the margin percentage will play out where it does based off the volumes. But we're focused on -- you're seeing that sequential revenue increase
and also the EBITDA dollars flowing in the right direction.

In terms of your question around the cost of service, predominantly in Consumer, don't forget one of the items that we had in the second quarter
was a step-up in the network rent and lease of about $60 million a quarter as a result of the new lease payments we put in place. As you know,
under the accounting, you look at the total payments over the life of the lease and kind of flatline it irrespective of how the natural cash flow
payments flow.

So there was, obviously, a significant upgrade to our lease agreements. And that was a onetime step-up in the quarterly rate there that flowed
through the books at, say, about 60 -- $60 million, close to $0.01 a share impact from that. That should be the same going forward now. So that's
the biggest driver you're seeing on the cost of service.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

And so, Matt, just maybe a follow-up on that.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead, Dave.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

So just -- that's all in Consumer?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

The vast majority of the wireless network costs are allocated to Consumer. Some of that is in Business, but the majority is in Consumer. Obviously,
the majority of the customers, the majority of the wireless service revenue is in Consumer. And so the costs are going to be allocated largely in line
on a similar basis to that. So yes, most of it is in Consumer.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

And then probably worth noting that then your EPS guidance includes negative $0.03 for the 2, 3, 4Q impact of that increased tower expense?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Absolutely, that's fully baked into the guidance, that step-up in that cost. So that comes back to the underlying strength of the business that we
have even with that baked in as well.

Operator

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

I'm curious what you've learned during the pandemic and now the reopening about where customers want to transact for wireless, whether it's
upgrading phones or changing service providers. And are a large portion of wireless transactions simply destined to remain in physical locations
versus a virtual or online channel?

And then just a follow-up. You mentioned a number of markets that you've been focused on for Ultra Wideband and 5G Home. I'm just curious if
you could share some population and household coverage numbers for Ultra Wideband and Home for the end of '21 and the target for the end
of '22.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Now, of course, we see some changes in behavior when it comes to our customers. But we had already started building our omnichannel
that our customer can start on the web, and they can end in the store or they can start in the store and end on the phone and all of that in order
to see that we do this as seamless as possible.

But clearly, we see much more digital than before. But also when the economy came back and the vaccinations in the United States were coming
up on high levels, we also saw the traffic coming back in the stores. And so we have had, I would say, all our stores opening in the second quarter.
And we see much more foot traffic than we have seen in the previous quarters, not really back to prepandemic days but clearly fairly close.

So we think our customer is still going to want to come into a store and see our technology and our products, but they might be wanting to finish
the delivery and the purchase in a digital fora. And that's how we build our stores.

So we are working very closely to see that the new behaviors that we can meet, that's why so our customers really feel good about dealing with
us. And I think that our team are doing a great job in that area.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Mike, in terms of your question around the millimeter wave coverage, we don't really talk about the millimeter wave coverage in terms of
POPs. You heard Hans mention upfront that we're on track to seeing 5% to 10% of dense urban usage on millimeter wave by the end of the year.
That's a combination of more customers having 5G devices in their hands, customer activity moving back to more prepandemic levels and then
obviously, building out more millimeter wave sites.

JULY 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

We said we would do 14,000 sites this year, be at over 30,000 by the end of the year. I can tell you we are running well ahead of schedule for the
14,000 sites through the first half of the year. And so as we do that, we continue to add coverage. And then we said we'd expect to cover 1 million
to 2 million homes with millimeter wave open for sale by the end of the year, and we're on track with all of those items.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Any early look to 2022?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

The build continues to -- obviously, we're not going to give guidance for 2022, but everything the network team is doing, whether on millimeter
wave, whether on C-Band, and remember, we said we'd be at around 100 million POPs by -- during the first quarter next year. And we expect --
still on track to be at that level.

So at this point in time, I can't speak more highly about the work the network team is doing as they build, whether it's the fiber that, obviously, is
important to the network, the millimeter wave expansion, the C-Band expansion and continuing to have the best 4G network out there as well. So
they're doing a tremendous amount of activity, and they continue to be on both our 2021 plans and our longer term plans, too.

Operator

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner

Two quick questions. First of all, I want to return to a question that Phil asked. I didn't hear the discussion. Can you talk about the DISH wholesale
deal with AT&T, what your observations are and whether you were part of that negotiation? And then separately, if you could just comment on
whether you saw any significant impacts from the EBBP program during the quarter, either in your wireline business with Fios or your wireless
business?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Hey, when it comes to specific deals in the market, we don't comment on that. And apparently, this is something that AT&T won from T-Mobile.
So I cannot comment our involvement in it or not.

But as I said, we are open for business. We have a Network-as-a-Service strategy model, which is paying off well for us with the 5 vectors of growth.
And part of that is monetization of MVNOs, and we are very happy with what we have.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Craig, to your second question, we saw some of our customer base certainly participate in that during the course of the second quarter. I
wouldn't say it was a significant impact in our numbers, but we did certainly see our customers participating.

Douglas Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD

Two questions for me as well. I mean, first, AT&T moved to 30- and 36-month handset EIPs periods this quarter, and your churn is even lower than
theirs. So your customers stick around even longer on average. Have you thought about going longer than 24 months? And if not, why is 24 months
sort of the right period?

And I'm just really curious on C-Band as we try to figure out how to model 2022, and you get the licenses cleared and you flip the switch and light
that up for customers. As you go into 2022, how's your go-to-market strategy changed, if at all? And what do consumers sort of see in terms of
their experience that's going to be materially different? Obviously, it was a big investment, and I'm just sort of thinking through on a practical basis
what happens as that starts to kick in?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. Now I can start with the C-Band. For obvious reason, we think it's an important moment. We are both amplifying and accelerating our 5G in
the network, amplifying the opportunity. However, giving away our commercial ideas at the -- when we're going to launch this right now, we
wouldn't do that. But of course, we're excited over it.

We think it's going to be great for our customers. It's going to be fantastic performance, and it expands our 5G mobility options, our 5G fixed Fios
access options, and it also extends our 5G mobile edge compute options. So it's just playing straight into our -- to our strategy. So we are excited
over it, and we will come back, how we will bring that to our customers. So they are equally delighted as they are with our network today, but just
getting something that is so much superior than anybody else.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Hey, Doug, on your first question about the handset device payment period, we're very comfortable with the offers we have in the marketplace.
It's 24 months for a lot of items, some of the higher-priced items, it's a little bit longer just to manage that. But as you mentioned, the churn is very,
very strong, 0.65% in Consumer for phone churn shows that what we're doing with customers is working very, very effectively. If we feel the need
to adjust it, we will do so, but it will be based off of what we see customers need and not be focused on any impact on the accounting treatment
associated with it. So we will continue to be focused on finding the right offers for our customers. And I think you see from the results in the second
quarter, what we're doing is resonating with customers, both from an adds standpoint and also a churn standpoint, too.

Operator

The next question comes from Peter Supino of Bernstein.

Peter Supino - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Research Analyst

A couple of related questions. The first is one of your competitors has talked repeatedly about the network capacity improvements that come from
5G. If you adjust that company's target for M&A, you could infer that their capacity is up about 7x for their 5G expansion. And so I'm wondering if
you could suggest a similar number for Verizon's capacity and growth potential considering the wonderful investment in the C-Band.

And then on a related note, as it relates to the Home business, I'm curious if you could describe how you think about allocating the cost of spectrum

(technical difficulty)

JULY 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. On the first one, on the -- if you have been listening to what I've talked about around 5G before, first of all, 5G as a technology is better to
handle data than 4G, and that's obvious. 3G (sic) [4G] is better than 4G (sic) [3G] as well. So that's happening.

Then you need to add, too, that you're not only talking about spectrum, you're talking about how you engineer and how you build the network.
So in our case, of course, we see great opportunities for being able to handle much more data.

And remember, I mean, today, on the millimeter wave, we might use 400, sometimes 800 megahertz, but not more. And we have 1,600 megahertz
nationwide. So there's so much more we can do. And as Kyle showed at the Investor Day, our headroom in the network is bigger than before, and
that's before we start building what we're building right now.

So we feel really confident how much -- how many x we are doing. And remember, I mean, our 4G is already the best in the nation. And then we're
adding up right now what we're doing in 5G, that is also extraordinarily good. So others can talk and we usually execute, and we will continue with
that.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

So Peter, on the second part of your question about allocating cost of the spectrum, I'd reframe that and actually view it from the standpoint of
this is the first time that we've had wireless technology where we can drive multiple revenue streams off of the same network build, whether that
be the mobility, which has obviously been the foundation of 4G, 3G and everything since the start of wireless. But then the ability to also have fixed
wireless access, to also have the public mobile edge compute, all coming off of that same network build, that same network investment, we think,
gives us the opportunity to provide a very good return on the investment that we've made in both C-Band and millimeter wave.

Operator

The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays.

Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst

A couple, if I could. Firstly, on the nonpay churn front, obviously, that I think you guys noted the benefit because of some of the subsidy programs.
But at some point, that will probably reverse for the industry as a whole. So could you help us understand how big of an impact that typically is in
a normalized year, nonpay churn and how much of a tailwind that is right now to get a sense for what that might do when things normalize?

And then secondly, I mean, you have a lot of content bundles now. You also have the new deal with Apple Arcade. Could you give us some sense
for how this impacts your cost of service? I mean how much of the increase in cost of service is on account of this? You did quantify the lease
number, but it would be good to get some sense for what this is doing overall to cost versus ARPA kind of trends.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can. Matt will talk about nonpay churn. When it comes to the content deals, I mean, I think I've said it a couple of times now. I mean our whole
idea is to offering exclusive offers for our wireless customers. And we also want to offer that partnership to brands that we really think resonate
with us.

And the model, as we have spoken about before, is that this is incremental revenue for us. It's not only loyalty. It's actually incremental profit for
us. So it's a totally different model that might sometimes not been in the market before because suddenly, we use the best network, the best
distribution and the best brand to work with companies like Disney+, et cetera, to give our customers a premium experience on top of the
differentiation we already have with the Mix & Match.

JULY 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

And ultimately, when we make this customer to paying customers, we get our fair share of that because we, with our assets, have created it together
with the asset for Disney+, Discovery or gaming, et cetera. So that's how the model is working. And as I said before, we are very pleased with the
-- with, I think, we have 6 or 7 of these offerings in the market right now, and all of them are very positive to us and to our customers. And we will
continue to see if we can find more. And I think it's a unique model that we have created that nobody else has in the market.

And I said, again, it goes back to Ronan and the team being very, very innovative and creative to see that we bring the best to our customer, not
only the best network, but also the differentiation in offering. So I have to say I'm very pleased with that. And I said, we have more in the funnel.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

And Kannan, on your other question around the churn, I would say it's a very small number of basis points of benefit coming from the reduction
in what we call involuntary churn. And what you're also seeing in the total churn number is actually the benefits of the engagement with the
customer, the experience the customer has on the network, the other experiences we bring to that relationship that Hans has touched on being
a bigger piece of the strength in the overall phone churn number that we reported, especially on the Consumer side.

And in terms of the impact of cost of sales, obviously, the content cost associated with the items that Hans mentioned do flow through there. And
you should expect to see that number continue to be a contributor of that line.

But when we look at the overall profitability of bringing that together, the overall customer proposition, it's EBITDA additive to the business and
also brings a better experience to the customers. So we see that as a win-win.

Operator

Your last question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

Two, if I may. First off, on business EBITDA margins. At your Analyst Day back in March, you had guided to sustaining north of 25%. And we saw
that below that in the second quarter, also in the first quarter although there's that onetime impact. And it sounds like you're guiding for that to
continue to be below 25%.

I'm just curious what's changed so quickly that you're targeting below that target, at least it looks like for 2021? And then also as it relates to the
biggest upgrade ever promotion, when we look across the space competitively, obviously, AT&T has been doing something similar since the fourth
quarter. Even T-Mobile did something just yesterday.

Do you really look at this as a promotion and implying at some point, there is an expiration and you pull that from the market? Or is this really just
the new way of competing in today's competitive market and really something that investors should assume in some form or the other is going
to be with us for a long period, if not permanently?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can make a quick answer on the promotion, and Matt will come back. We have already pulled the biggest 5G upgrade from the market, that we
did.

JULY 21, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Today. Yes. So yes, we see it as coming in and out when it's the right moment, but Matt will probably comment a little bit more on it.

On the Business side, I mean, in Q4 2018, Matt and I talked about that. We think that this is one of the great opportunities we have over time with
the Business side. And remember, we have never consolidated our Business side. It was compartmentalized in between all the different business
we have.

Tami and the team have during that moment -- and remember, we said we're going to invest in order to see that we have the platforms of products
of CX and UX for our customers to be harmonized in order to be able to scale this to be a good business. And that they are doing, and they probably
are halfway through it. They're doing a lot of transformation in the business.

At the same time, there are some headwinds as we have seen before. I mean that would be the wireline sort of cyclical or -- no, it's not cyclical. It's
a sustained decline. And then we have a wireless business where we take more than our fair share. We are leading in all segments. And that balance,
of course, is coming into this quarter. Of course, we had more hardware this quarter as well.

And then we're building off -- for the new opportunities with 5G mobile edge compute, private 5G networks, the 5G Business Internet, which is
using fixed wireless access. So we have a lot of new products coming out as we're building, and we have the same ambitions when it comes to
financials, then we will be realistic what's happening in the market and how the team -- but I'm proud of the team of what they are transforming
to and what we're aspiring for. And seeing the progress on mobile edge compute and Business Internet, that's, of course, new opportunities that
we have not seen coming into the P&L yet, but we're building it together with the transformation we're doing.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So just a couple of other comments on the business margin there, Colby. So Hans mentioned the higher volumes. We mentioned it upfront
that the wireless volumes that we saw the gross adds were not just higher than 2Q last year, also higher than 2Q '19. So certainly seeing volumes
come back, especially in enterprise and small, medium business. So that's having some impact there and then obviously, the wireline pressure.

I would expect second half margins to be reasonably similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. The business transformation work the team
is doing is having positive impacts with more to come as we go forward here. So I feel good about the direction the team is headed there in spite
of the secular wireline pressures that we see.

And then in terms of your question on promotions, as Hans said, it's a promotion. That means it has both a start date and an end date, and today
is the end date. So we've run promotions since the beginning of the wireless industry. They've evolved over time. They will continue to do so.

And the great position we're in is because of the strong operational results and financial results, it gives us the ability when the time is right in the
marketplace to bring the right promotion out there. We felt this was the right promotion at this time with the economic reopening and wanting
to get more customers with a 5G device in their hand as we're about to launch C-Band within the next 6 months, so we will continue to look at
what is the right promotion for the right time. But the underlying operational performance of the business showing up in sequential wireless service
revenue increase yet again gives us the position to have flexibility as we think about how we approach the market.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Great. Thanks, Colby. That's all the time we have today for questions. Thanks, everybody, and be safe.

JULY 22, 2022 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2022 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call 

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.24 per share on a GAAP 
basis. Reported second quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $435 million, including a net pretax charge of 
approximately $198 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities. 

In addition, the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $237 million. Excluding the effects of 
these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the second quarter. 

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter was not a good barometer for where Verizon has been or where 
it's going. While we are not satisfied with our performance, we know what the issues are, and we're already executing to reaccelerate in the second 
half of the year. 

As I said in our first quarter earnings call and reiterated since, we're seeing weaker consumer wireless volumes. The inflationary environment is 
clearly impacting consumer behavior, and we also saw intensified competition for consumer attention. The result was a significant impact on our 
gross adds. 

Based on our performance this quarter and analysis of the landscape, we're updating our financial guidance by lowering our expectation for service 
and other revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Matt will provide more detail in a few minutes. 

As you know, we have already responded. Last week, we launched our Welcome Unlimited plan for Consumer wireless that will meet the needs of 
budget-conscious consumers without providing device subsidies. In addition to these new plans, we took pricing actions in both of our business 
units to mitigate inflationary pressures. 

In Consumer, we also adjusted prices for some legacy metered plans, increasing revenue per plan while motivating step-ups to our Unlimited 
offerings. All of these actions position us for improved performance in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. 

More than ever, our leadership team is focused on executing our strategy through operational and customer-focused solutions. While I'm confident 
that we have the right strategy in place, we will continue to refine our approach as the consumer market evolves. 

Looking further into our business, we continue to see momentum that gives us confidence in our ability to improve performance over the long 
term. In our Consumer Group, we have consistently pursued a disciplined strategy of offering high-quality services at the competitive prices. We 
know the economic pressures that our customers are facing and are carefully bringing new offers to meet their needs. 

I'm personally working with the Consumer group to define our disciplined approach to the market while also looking closely at how we operate 
and do business. This is reflected in the plans and promotions we introduced in May, June and July. 

Mix and Match continues to drive premium plan adoption, with 78% of our consumer base on Unlimited plans and 39% on Premium Unlimited. 
We have seen healthy step-ups for 5 consecutive quarters, which continues to drive ARPA growth, and there is room for more. 

While consumer budgets are becoming strained, we continue to find ways of delivering new valuable services while recognizing that the handset 
subsidies we're seeing in our industry are not sustainable long term. Our new Welcome Unlimited plan is a great example of this. 

We have tailored offers for the full range of Consumer segment from premium to value across postpaid and prepaid to meet all consumer needs 
in this challenging market condition. In the prepaid value segment, our integration of TracFone is on schedule and provide us with another suite 
of offerings to bring consumers onto our network.

JULY 22, 2022 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2022 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call 

Our fixed wireless access solution continues to bring us new connections. Across Consumer and Business, we increased fixed wireless net adds by 
32% over the first quarter, driven by a 50% increase from our Consumer group. 

In our Business group, we again delivered excellent wireless volumes, with 430,000 net adds, including 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the 
quarter. This marks our third consecutive quarter exceeding 200,000 wireless phone net adds. 

In the Global Enterprise market, businesses, government agencies and other institutions continue to recognize the power of Verizon's network 
and the importance of digitalization. This week, we announced an over $400 million project with the FBI to help the Bureau meet its global bandwidth 
demands. We will provide direct access to their development team, and we'll advise on system enhancements like cloud computing, video and 
imaging transmissions and data applications. 

We'll also offer private 5G solutions to optimize complex organizations. We recently partnered with the Virginia International Terminals to build a 
Private 5G network across its seaports campus. This network is scalable to replace Wi-Fi with more secure connectivity. 

We're seeing new opportunities and increased demand for these network solutions from enterprises and other organizations. Verizon is uniquely 
positioned to take advantage of the moment and provide the highest-quality private networks to these customers. 

Private networks are the gateway to Mobile Edge Compute, which can deliver game-changing customer outcomes, including revenue growth, 
new customer experiences and cost savings. During the second quarter, we expanded our MEC ecosystem by bringing AWS Wavelength zones to 
Nashville and Tampa and now reached 19 metro areas. This means that 75% of the U.S. population is now within 150 miles of Verizon's 5G Edge. 

In partnership with Truist, we supported the launch of their 10,000-square foot (sic) [100,000-square foot] Innovation Technology Center in Charlotte, 
North Carolina. As a founding member of the Innovators in Residence program, we will help create a global hub for the development of 5G and 
MEC application in the Financial Service segment. This trend will continue to create growth opportunities for us across a range of industries, as we 
are a market leader in 5G private networks and in Mobile Edge Compute. 

The momentum in Verizon Business is a fitting send-off for Group CEO, Tami Erwin, who is ending her amazing 35-year career at Verizon. We 
promoted Sampath as the Verizon's Business CEO on July 1. Sampath brings over 2 decades of experience in digital networks, critical infrastructure 
protection and a deep understanding on how networks play a role in enterprise growth and global security. He has been part of the Verizon team 
for more than 8 years, and I know that he is the right leader to take Verizon Business forward. 

The power of our networks gives us the flexibility to meet the needs of our customers across Consumer and Business. The continued and speedy 
expansion of our network and capabilities creates agility and optionality within our larger strategy. 

We ended the quarter with 135 million POPs covered by C-Band and remain on track to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of the year. With 
the early clearance that we announced in March, we're expanding service into an additional 30 markets and have started deploying 100 megahertz 
of C-Band spectrum in many markets across the U.S., almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G. 

We're seeing the phenomenal performance we expected. Network usage is growing quickly, with C-Band users up 233% since the end of the first 
quarter and millimeter wave traffic up 49% year-to-date. Where C-Band is deployed, it accounts for more than 1/3 of our wireless traffic on average. 
Consumers are also equipped with the devices they need to use 5G. Currently, 47% of our consumer base has a 5G phone, and we expect that 
number to reach nearly 60% by year-end. 

Our already-best wireless network continues to earn recognition for its performance and dependability. This month, J.D. Power gave us the highest 
number of awards for network quality for the 29th time in a row. And RootMetrics recognized us for having the best overall network performance 
in the country for the 18th time in 9 years.

JULY 22, 2022 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2022 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call 

Turning to the second half of the year. We will continue to listen to our customers and give them reason to sign up, stay and upgrade with us. This 
month, we also added, on top of our yearly business transformation, a multiyear program to enhance our efficiency measures and accelerate the 
cost benefits delivered. This will ensure that our balance sheet remains strong for the market ahead. 

We run Verizon with the goal of growing our business and controlling costs. We will never shy away from investing a portion of our cost savings 
in our growth initiatives. We are confident in our ability to deliver both efficiency and growth while creating long-term value for our shareholders. 

Before I turn it over to Matt to give you more details on our results and our outlook for the second half of the year, I want to mention that we 
reached a tentative deal with our unions to extend our collective bargaining agreement. This extension will provide us with labor stability focused 
on our customers and opportunities to grow our business over the next 4 years. 

By that, I hand it over to Matt. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. As Hans said, this was a challenging quarter, and our results did not meet the expectations we 
have set for ourselves. We have implemented multiple actions to better position Verizon for the future. At the same time, we expect the market 
environment to continue to be very competitive for the remainder of 2022. 

Before discussing our expectations for the remainder of the year, let's walk through results from the second quarter, beginning with an overview 
of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our runway for mobility growth is predicated on driving our customer base into higher-value data plans, 
and we continued to make good progress in the second quarter. 

Premium penetration within our consumer base increased to 39% at quarter-end, and 57% of new accounts in the quarter selected Premium 
Unlimited. And step-ups within our existing base remained healthy. This activity helped drive a 2.4% year-over-year increase in Consumer postpaid 
ARPA. 

Our recent administrative fee increase and economic adjustment charge began to show on customers' bills in the last few days of the second 
quarter. And we expect close to a full quarter's benefit to revenue and ARPA trends in the third quarter while our metered price changes will be 
phased-in throughout the third quarter, which will provide an additional uplift. 

We reported postpaid phone net adds of 12,000 in the second quarter as strong Business results more than offset softer Consumer performance. 
Business delivered 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand across all lines of the Business group as 
phone gross adds were up nearly 30% from the same period a year ago, and we expect this strong performance to continue. 

On the Consumer side, postpaid phone net losses were 215,000 in the quarter and stemmed from 2 main drivers. First, churn increased by 10 basis 
points compared to the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn contributed roughly half of the increase due to the expiration of state 
consumer protection policies and less stimulus funding. This was coupled with an 11% decline in phone gross adds from the prior year, driven by 
the competitive offerings in the marketplace. 

As Hans indicated, we recently introduced a Welcome plan in order to drive demand for more price-conscious consumers, particularly as they make 
spending adjustments due to the effects of higher inflation. This new plan is well positioned to attract new customers, especially for those who 
bring their own device. 

It is our most basic Unlimited offering with no device promotions or many of the other features available in Mix and Match Unlimited plans. We 
reserve our most generous acquisition and retention offers for consumers willing to select our Premium Unlimited plans, and we believe that 
opportunities exist to better serve these high-value customers.

JULY 22, 2022 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2022 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call 

Upgrade activity remained elevated throughout the quarter, reflecting loyalty within our core customer base while also serving to drive greater 
premium adoption. As a result, total postpaid phone activations across Consumer and Business were up 8% from the same period last year. 

Let's now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. During the second quarter, we continued to scale and grow our nationwide broadband 
opportunity with additional expansion of fixed wireless households and businesses covered. In addition, we expanded Fios availability to an 
additional 150,000 homes during the quarter and are on track to achieve our target of 550,000 incremental homes open for sale in 2022. 

Total broadband net adds were 268,000 in the quarter, an increase of 39,000 sequentially in what is traditionally a seasonally softer quarter. Fixed 
wireless momentum accelerated as we added 256,000 subscribers in the quarter, up from 194,000 in 1Q. Fixed wireless net adds have increased 
every month throughout 2022, and we expect to continue that trend in the third quarter. 

We also added 36,000 Fios Internet net adds during the second quarter. While Fios Internet churn remains well below pre-pandemic levels, we are 
seeing softer gross adds due to lower-than-expected switching activity from moves and fewer new home purchases. We recently introduced Fios 
Mix and Match 3.0 that aligns our Fios and fixed wireless pricing and better positions us to grow joint account penetration. 

Now let's talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our integration of TracFone is on track, and the team remains focused on enhancing the customer 
value proposition and delivering cost synergies through migrating off-net customers onto the Verizon network. 

Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of 227,000 in the second quarter, and total Verizon prepaid net losses were 229,000. These results 
exclude a base adjustment of 402,000 related to a competitor's 3G shutdown. Our prepaid volumes were impacted by aggressive postpaid 
promotions. As we made progress on our TracFone integration initiatives, we will be better positioned to serve those customers wanting to migrate 
to postpaid offerings. 

Our business case had anticipated subscriber losses during the early phase of the integration period, which we expect to continue into the second 
half of the year. However, should customer preferences shift to the value market amid recessionary concerns, we would expect to see some benefits. 
Prepaid ARPU was $31.26 in the quarter, up modestly on a sequential basis, and we expect it to remain stable going forward. 

Now let's move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was relatively flat year-over-year as wireless 
service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue were offset primarily by wireline declines and the net impacts of last year's M&A 
activity. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.1%, primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, further progress on our Premium Unlimited 
strategy and strong Business volumes. 

Service and other revenue was down 3.9% for the quarter as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from 
TracFone. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 billion for the quarter, down 2.6% year-over-year due to the divestiture of Verizon Media, higher device 
subsidies and promotional spending associated with the increased wireless activations, wireline revenue declines and inflationary cost pressures. 

Regarding inflation, we are seeing the pressures within our cost structure, most notably on labor costs, utilities and transportation and logistics 
expenses. We expect these pressures to accelerate in the second half of the year and have an impact on profitability and earnings. 

As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.31, down 5.8% from the prior year. This primarily reflects the impact 
of our adjusted EBITDA results and higher D&A related to our C-Band rollout. 

Now let's take a look at our second quarter Consumer financial results. Total Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 9.1% year-over-year, driven 
by the inclusion of TracFone, higher equipment revenue and core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 10.5% 
year-over-year, also driven by the inclusion of TracFone and postpaid ARPA growth. 

Total Fios revenue was flat versus the same period a year ago as Internet growth was offset by video and voice declines. Consumer EBITDA was 
$10.4 billion, down 0.3% compared to the same period last year. A higher contribution from TracFone was more than offset primarily by higher 
promotional activity. Consumer EBITDA margin was 40.5% in the quarter.

JULY 22, 2022 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2022 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call 

Now let's take a close look at the Business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment's wireless results remained strong in 2Q, while wireline 
service declines continued amid a softening economy and ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 3.0% was up from 2.1% 
last quarter. 

Small and Medium Business continued its strong momentum, accelerating growth for the second consecutive quarter, while Global Enterprise had 
its best performance since the first quarter of 2020. Business wireline declines were elevated this quarter, in part due to foreign currency and federal 
USF, which together impacted growth by more than 300 basis points year-over-year. The secular pressures from technology migration continued 
to weigh on legacy voice and data services, and we expect this trend to continue. 

Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year. In addition to wireline revenue declines, we experienced elevated 
device subsidies related to the 15% year-over-year increase in wireless activations in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 22.9% in the second quarter. 

Moving on to Slide 13 and the cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2022 totaled $17.7 billion compared with 
$20.4 billion in the prior year period. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased 
inventory levels as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. 

Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.5 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of 
$2.8 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $7.2 billion for the first half of the year. 

We exited the quarter with $130.6 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement of $5 billion resulting in a net unsecured debt-to-adjusted 
EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. In a period of rising interest rates, our balance sheet is in a strong position, with less than $2 billion of unsecured bonds 
maturing in the next 18 months. 

Lastly, let's move to an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for 
the year. We now expect wireless service revenue growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%, down from the prior 9% to 10% range. The pricing 
actions already implemented are expected to contribute approximately $1 billion in the second half of 2022. 

However, this benefit is expected to be offset by the accounting impact of promotional activity and the impact of lower net adds. As a result of the 
reduction in wireless service revenue expectations and anticipated ongoing wireline pressures, we now expect service and other revenue growth 
to be in the range of minus 1% to flat. 

We are lowering our adjusted EBITDA growth expectations for the full year to a range of minus 1.5% to flat versus our prior range of 2% to 3%. This 
revised outlook accounts for higher levels of activations, driven by our promotional activity, inflation-driven costs that we discussed previously, 
the reduction in wireless service revenue and Business wireline revenue headwinds. 

Our guidance assumes Consumer EBITDA margin in 3Q to be similar to margins seen in the first half, with typical seasonality in 4Q. Business EBITDA 
margins in the second half of 2022 are expected to be in line with those reported in the first half of the year. 

Finally, we are lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.10 to $5.25 versus the prior $5.40 to $5.55 range. This view reflects the 
reduction in adjusted EBITDA as well as incremental cash interest expense versus our expectations at the beginning of the year of about $300 
million for the full year compared with the $150 million to $200 million we estimated last quarter due to updated market expectations for additional 
Fed fund rate increases. 

For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business-as-usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion of C-Band-related 
spending. In closing, we are confident in our strategy and believe that our assets position us well to generate long-term shareholder value. 

I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to questions. Thank you.

JULY 22, 2022 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2022 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you, Matt. In summary, we view this quarter and second half challenges as short term. We have a strong and resilient business model that 
is well suited to deliver favorable financial results, even in uncertain economic times. 

In this environment, we remain disciplined and focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through improved revenue and profitability, 
with healthy cash generation that supports our network investments and dividend policy as well as a strong balance sheet. We also have the best 
team in the industry, and I know they are ready to deliver. 

The actions we have taken in our Consumer business creates an opportunity to solidify Consumer performance. Those actions include new postpaid 
plans and our continued integration of TracFone. Fixed wireless access for both Consumer and Business has proven to be a powerful connectivity 
solution. We expect our nationwide broadband presence and our fixed wireless subscriber base to grow well into the future. We will continue to 
drive Business wireless subscriptions and expand our MEC ecosystem. 

Taken together, and combined with our accelerated efficiencies work, our actions during the quarter address our competitive challenges. And we'll 
continue to listen to our customers and thoughtfully respond in the marketplace. Our second quarter initiatives are designed to strengthen our 
Network-as-a-Service strategy, which uses the power of our network to drive results from our 5 vectors of growth. 

Thank you for all, and we're ready to take your questions. Brady, back to you. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for questions. 

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

Operator 

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. 

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst 

And 2 questions, if you don't mind. Yesterday, AT&T cited that they were seeing a delay in the collections of payments, specifically from their 
consumer customer base. So I was curious, have you seen any stretching out of DSOs or bad debt expense? And really, what's embedded in your 
outlook, especially if you're anticipating that the macro remains a bit tougher? 

And then the second question is, you outlined some of the steps you've taken from a price plan standpoint to sort of better position your Consumer 
Wireless business. Is there anything else you think you need to do at this point? Or is it mostly execution-driven? And all in, do you think the steps 
you have taken so far are sufficient to get back to positive Consumer postpaid phone net adds in the third quarter or at some point in the second 
half of the year? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you, Brett. I can start with the second part of it. As you said, I mean, we have taken several actions in the quarter, aggressive all the way from 
the new Unlimited plan with bring your own device and no subsidy. And then, of course, we also have done our increases on the pricing actions 
we have taken.

So we've taken that, but we constantly now evaluate if we need to do something more. But we will be very conscious and disciplined in the market 
because I don't think that it's sustainable long term to continue with the subsidized model. So we will pulse in and pulse out, of course. It's a holiday 
season, of course, that will be there. So we will work with that one. But clearly, that will do. 

But remember, also, if you look at our value -- our premium segment, this is in the high end, we're doing really well. We have high-quality customers. 
You see the step-ups continuing. So what we are addressing right now is the metered and low-end Unlimited, which are more price conscious 
right now. And that's what we're addressing with it. 

So we are more surgical than just making any blanket decisions here. So that's very good. And on top of that, we feel good about TracFone. Of 
course, if the market would turn even worse, I mean, we have TracFone. And then we can play in all segments and meet all the demand from 
different customers. But clearly, we're staying extremely close to it. 

With Matt and I and Manon and her team, we work weekly to see where the market is going, if we need to adjust. But we will always think about 
how we -- our financial discipline and how we preserve cash. Because we always need to think 2x before we bring in customers. We want high-quality 
customers. 

Matt, maybe you can comment on the customer base. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. Thanks, Hans. And thanks for the question, Brett. So -- and actually building on your last comment there, Hans, about high-quality customers. 
Brett, that shows up in the payment patterns we're seeing. We haven't seen any noticeable change in the payment patterns from customers, 
continues to be very good, very much in line with what we were seeing pre-COVID, in fact, slightly better than that time period. 

And when you look at the quality of the business we're writing, the FICO scores in our DPP portfolio have never been higher. So at this point in 
time, we're continuing to see the type of strong payment patterns that you would expect from the high-quality customer base that we have. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Yes. Great. Thanks, Brett.

The next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. 

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD 

You noted a few times some of the pricing actions that you've recently taken, both the price increases but also the recent Unlimited Welcome offer 
at $30. Could you give us a little bit of early reads in the marketplace, your ability for customers to digest these price increases, maybe move to 
other plans as well as any incremental traffic that you're seeing from the new Unlimited plans? And are those customers taking that offer? Or is this 
really driving door swings to maybe trade up to one of the higher offers as well? 

And then secondly, last quarter, you did talk about store traffic deteriorating in the later part of the quarter around the war, et cetera. Be great to 
get a sense of how store traffic has trended through 2Q and into Q3. Is it pretty consistent with those levels you saw? Or has it deteriorated further?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

On the prices, let me start, and Matt will add in there. Of course, the pricing actions we took with price increases and on the metered plan and 
adjustments, that, we will see coming into play in the second half of this year. So that we will, of course, expect some of it. There might be some 
consumers that are cost conscious that will do disconnects and that we're calculating with. 

On the Welcome Unlimited, which is a segmentation of the Unlimited market, it's a little bit too early to say. It's only been in the market for, I think, 
7 or 8 days. So it's a little bit early to say. We think we're addressing the markets -- a part of the market where we had some outflows in the second 
quarter, and we have taken that action aggressively with this plan. But clearly, we also see opportunities for having step-ups in that plan as well 
from our customers. 

Matt, anything more? 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

No. Just one thing I'd add to Hans' response, Simon. Certainly, we expect to see significant benefit in the second half of the year from the actions 
we've taken. I mentioned that in my comments. That's probably about $1 billion of incremental revenue sequentially in the second half versus the 
first half. 

I would expect, and we have assumed in our forward view, that we'll see a small bubble in churn here in the third quarter as a result of customers 
as they get those price increases or meet their plans or whatever else. But apart from that, we expect to see significant benefit from the actions 
we've taken. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

And maybe -- sorry, I didn't answer on the store traffic there, I realized that. So as we said in the first quarter and through the second quarter, we 
had a little bit less of traffic in our stores in April and May and the latter part of March. We saw some pickup in June, but still a little bit below earlier 
trends. But that might be just the market and how it's working right now. But other than that, nothing special. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Thanks, Simon.

The next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. 

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst 

First, a follow-up, if I can, and I don't mean this to sound disrespectful. But on one hand, you're raising prices with fees. On the other hand, you're 
bringing in lower-priced discounted offers. And I know you're offering loyalty credits to customers who call and complain about pricing. And it 
seems like you're out of the market. 

So do you think that your network is going to return to its dominance, and you can sort of get through this period? Or do you think you need to 
really readdress your competitive position in order to maintain share? I'm sorry to return to something you've talked about a few times already, 
but I'm really having a hard time with it.

JULY 22, 2022 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2022 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you, Phil. First of all, we feel really good about our network and the quality of the network. It's actually better than ever and as you hear us 
talking as well. We are just in the midst of the C-Band rollout, which is extremely strong and the performance we see on it. And we just are passing 
over 130-plus million POPs on it, and by year-end, at least 175 million. So we're going to have many more customers getting the benefit of the 
C-Band. 

So now we feel good about that. I mean, you saw the RootMetrics, you saw the -- both of the J.D. Power as well having us as the Best Network. So 
we don't feel that is a difference. 

What we're doing right now, I think that's -- we have to be clear -- very clear, Phil. We are segmenting the market. So where we now have the 
Welcome plan, that's a segment of the Unlimited and metered plan. On the high end, we have -- as Matt said, we have really good sort of loyalty. 
We see step-ups, exactly as we outlined in our plans. That's what we're see being continued. And that's why we saw the ARPA increase in this 
quarter, and we see continuous step-up. 

So I think, not only think, I'm confident our strategy is working. We're just addressing a segment in this economical time. So I feel really good about 
the strategy and how we do it. And we will continue to be very focused on cash flow and getting the right type of customers because we believe 
high-quality customers are important. And that means loyalty, it means also a very good base to build on. So we feel good about the strategy. I 
understand your question, but I feel really good about it. 

Matt, anything else? 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. Hans, maybe the only other thing I'd add on is, Phil, one of the things we've done during the current quarter, we mentioned last time that 
we've reached an agreement with some of the satellite companies to get early clearing on outside the initial 46 C-Band markets. And in those 
markets, we're not turning on 60 megahertz, but 100 megahertz of the C-Band. 

And the difference in the speeds that we're seeing with 100 megahertz versus 60 is exactly in line with what we'd expect. But it tells us that we 
have a path to a very, very strong network performance. We really like what we're seeing on C-Band today. But when we get the full amount 
deployed, it's going to be an uptick even further. So we absolutely believe that a network-driven strategy will allow us to continue to perform very 
well.

The next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. 

Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Research Analyst 

This is Batya for John. Can you talk a little bit about how you expect fixed wireless trends to trend from here? Is there an opportunity to expand 
maybe the addressable market as you build C-Band further? And maybe an update of what percent of that fixed wireless base is new to Verizon. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Great question. No, first of all, we feel really good about our 5 vectors of growth. And in one of the vectors, of course, we have national broadband. 
This was exactly what we envisioned when we rolled out the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network in 2017, that we can have multiple opportunities

to address the market. And fixed wireless actually is just humming for us, I mean, 32% growth, 50% growth in the Consumer Group. This is all about 
us deploying the network. 

Of course, we have millimeter wave and we have 4G in the fixed wireless access, but the C-Band, both, they gave a coverage and an enormous, 
good performance as well. So as we roll out and hitting more households, we are going to -- we can grow even faster. So our expectation, Matt's 
and mine, is of course that we will continue to have that opportunity to grow right now from the base we have as we're opening most households. 
But remember, from the open household to (inaudible), et cetera, is a little bit time lag because the direct marketing and all of that is working 
through, but we feel really good about. 

We feel also good about our Fios, even though it was a little bit less of net adds on Fios because less movements, I guess, in this environment, 
nothing strange. But really good performance on Fios when it comes to the network and our customer base and our churn. So all in all, the national 
broadband is playing really good for us. And this was a strategy from the beginning. I have high expectations. Matt has high expectation on it as 
well. Our teams are executing from the network to our commercials. 

Matt? 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Batya, so just one maybe data point for you on fixed wireless. About 30% of our FWA adds, what we would call new, new to Verizon, where we 
didn't have an existing relationship with them. So obviously, we like the ability of taking an existing Verizon customer and adding a service. But 
when you bring a completely new customer on the platform, that's pretty exciting as well. So hopefully, that helps your question. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Thanks, Batya.

The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. 

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD 

I guess, my first one, Matt. We've thrown out a couple of numbers, $1 billion of top line and incremental benefit from pricing plans, maybe $300 
million of incremental interest from presumably floating rate debt. If we talk about some of the other numbers you talked about, we threw out 
some math around inflation and the impact it could have on the $20 billion of expenses that's exposed to inflation. Kind of what's the inflation 
headwind dollar number that you're budgeting for? And then when we talked about this equipment and supply chain working capital headwind, 
what kind of dollar number are we talking about there? 

And then, Hans, I think you mentioned in passing the CB agreement or agreement in principle that you signed, I think, last week. It seems like a 
potentially dangerous time with the inflation that we have around us right now to be kind of locking into multiyear collective bargaining agreements. 
Could you talk about why this is happening and why you feel comfortable doing it now? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Matt, start.

JULY 22, 2022 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2022 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes, Dave. So thank you for the question. So look, as you think about the guide at the EBITDA level, as you say, there's about $1 billion of revenue 
sequential uptick. But then the offset to that, you've got the promotional spend that is certainly running at a higher level than we thought at the 
beginning of the year based off what we're seeing in the marketplace. 

And we're making the assumption that we're going to see that type of level for the balance of the year, that's baked in there. Of the reduction in 
EBITDA growth from the 2% to 3% down to the minus 1.5% to flat, 75 to 100 basis points of that is coming from inflation and our assumption of 
that for the full year versus our original plans for the year. 

On the working capital side, you've got a couple of things playing in there. One is, over the last couple of years, we've had some artificial working 
capital headwinds caused by COVID as volumes came down. Transaction volumes came down. That gave us some lower DPP balances that was a 
favor to working capital. We now, of course, see volumes increasing again. And so you've got that reverting to more normal levels, on top of which, 
moving to 36-month DPP will increase the amount of outstanding balances versus what we saw pre-COVID. 

So we'll work through a large chunk of that this year. And I would expect to see less of a working capital headwind half of this year, but that's 
certainly in the -- you'll see that in the free cash flow right now. We feel very good about the cash flow generation about the business going forward 
and what we'll achieve as we work through this current period. 

Hans, I'll hand it over to you for the union question. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Yes. Thank you. And maybe just a comment on the supply chain because there's a lot of discussion around that. And I have to say that Verizon has 
done a great job on our supply chain, around the whole supply chain and secure that. I mean, you can see that in our rollout on our C-Band millimeter 
wave and everything else we're doing in the network that were way ahead of our earlier plans. And that's, of course, how we have secured our 
supply chain, I really want to say. 

When it comes to the unions, I mean, we have reached -- as I said in my remarks, we have reached a tentative agreement on the bargaining 
agreement with them. And we have a great partnership with the unions. So we think this is an important one. You have to see that we secured the 
workloads we'll have in the future and see that we continue to have a great working relationship with the unions. So that's why we have this 
tentative agreement.

The next question is from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. 

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst 

You're discussing the strength of your Business wireless segment, and your competitors are also talking about stronger business wireless performance. 
I'm just curious if there's something larger afoot within this segment in terms of behavior and the way businesses are buying wireless? 

Related to that, is that possibly coming out of what was traditionally the Consumer market? So is there some kind of shift that's also happening 
underneath the industry in terms of where sales are coming into?

And then just one other. I'm just thinking about what you talked about in terms of the change in guidance for revenue and EBITDA for this year. 
And I'm curious how this informs the multiyear outlook that the company previously established and the relationship you're seeing longer term 
between the performance of revenue and profitability. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you. On the Business wireless, you have seen us now for several quarters having a really good run on it. Our conclusion and our confidence 
level is high that our mission-critical networks is so important for our customers, and that's why we see such a good traction on it. I think it's normally, 
there are probably some leakage in between Consumer to Small and Medium, but it's also from Small and Medium to Consumer. 

So that, I don't think, is anything different than what I've seen before, but it's always some type of movements in between. So we feel really good 
about our Business wireless and how they are performing and how our customers like our network. 

On the second question, as I said also before, I mean, we think it's a short-term challenging times right now. Long term, we are confident that this 
is a great market. We have great assets, and we can execute on our plans. 

So I'm -- whatever we have done in the last 5 years here with the network, with our divestments and acquisitions, we have positioned ourselves 
for a really good long-term strategy in a market where mobility, broadband and cloud are the most important digital assets for consumers and 
businesses. I couldn't dream to have another position that we have today. So I'm confident about the long term of our business. 

Matt, anything else? 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. Hans, maybe just a couple of things. Mike, if you think back pre-COVID, Verizon Business Group had very strong performance. Obviously, COVID 
was very disruptive to the Business segment. You've seen the recovery in net adds over the past year now be very strong. And you're seeing that 
show up in the service revenue growth, up to 3% this quarter, up sequentially 2 quarters in a row now, and we do expect that to continue at a 
strong pace. 

And as Hans said, we're not going to comment on multiyear outlook at this point, but certainly feel like the actions that we are taking and have 
taken and will continue to work on put us on a path to EBITDA growth as we go forward here. So look forward to, obviously, updating you on that 
as we get into next year. 

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst 

One just quick follow-up, if I could. With going through the pandemic and kind of where we are today, there's a bigger work-from-home and hybrid 
work environment. Is that emboldening companies to kind of shift from what felt like, for years, they were trying to get out of like buying devices 
and services for their employees. And is that emboldening them to now, because of this different work environment, actually buy wireless 
communications on behalf of their employees differently than maybe 2 or 3 years ago? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thanks. I think I actually see both. I mean, we see -- we saw a trend over the years of bring your device from enterprises. But actually, in order to 
secure a more seamless experience for enterprise customers, we see more now customers actually going back and actually supplying the devices 
of our customers. It's a little bit dependent on what type of business they're into, I have to say. But we see a little bit of a trend going in the other 
direction right now.

JULY 22, 2022 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2022 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call 

Think about building private 5G networks, where you want everybody to have a seamless wireless -- 5G wireless experience inside an office and 
then going out on the street and having Verizon's commercial network. Then you need to deploy a handset that is actually coming from the 
company in order to manage it. So we see actually both. I don't think it's an accentuated trend, at least, as I can tell from taking the question on 
this level. 

On the other thing, I just want to give another data point as well. I mean, remember, I talked a lot about handoffs in the networks during COVID. 
It was sometimes down 60% in New York City that people didn't move. We are back to the hands off, that means -- handovers. It seems like people 
are moving equally much right now as we're doing pre-COVID. It's, of course, a different buckets. 

But on the high level, when we look at the network, handovers are back to normal and actually even a little bit more. That can, of course, depend 
on that how much more equipment we have deployed in 2 years. But that's what we see. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Thanks, Mike.

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. 

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst 

Hans, I wonder, as we think about growth, maybe we revisit some of the comments you've made over the past couple of years about 5G. As the 
market has evolved, what is your latest thinking about the opportunity, both for the industry and for Verizon specifically, as it relates to some of 
the new revenue opportunities that seemed so promising a couple of years back, like Mobile Edge Compute and private networks and that sort of 
thing? 

Is there -- is it right that I think there's a broad sense among investors that sort of the bloom is off the rose a bit for those opportunities? And they 
may not be as big and as attractive as we once would have hoped? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you, Craig. If we take the 3 different business models we deployed in the network for 5G, I mean, fixed wireless access, so if I take that first, 
that definitely is happening all the way, that everybody was questioning if fixed wireless access is something you can do. We feel really good about 
it. The capacity in the network is there, there's no problem. And as Matt said, we have deployed 60 megahertz of the C-Band. We have, in average, 
160. So we have so much more to go. So that one is definitely happening. 

On the mobility, 5G mobility, yes, short term is a little bit more challenging. I think that comes from both economical situation in the market. Long 
term, I see the same. As I said before, the step-ups and going to higher plans is a great opportunity for us. And as you saw in this quarter, our ARPA 
went up. Our high-end customers continued to do step-ups. So both of those are happening. And 47% of our customers has a 5G phone. And by 
year-end, we would probably be near at least 60%. So I think those are happening. 

When it comes to Mobile Edge Compute and IoT, we also have a really good trend on that. It has pivoted a little bit right now and starting with 
private 5G networks and then it goes over to Mobile Edge Compute when you bring in the cloud experience in it. So you saw that during the 
quarter, we announced several private 5G networks. We see more and more customers feeling that, that's a good replacement for them in order 
to have a secure high-capacity network instead of having WiFi in many cases.

And the reason why it's happening right now is now devices are coming out. And the next couple of years, we're going to see so many more devices 
and not talking only about smartphones. So I feel that it is the same opportunity that we have talked about all the time. Given the economic 
environment, there might be always some changes to it. But long term, I see no difference to it, and that's how we build the network. 

And we are the world leader in Mobile Edge Compute and private 5G networks. We feel that, that's a sweet spot for us. We've been all the time 
been very early with other 5G use cases as well and feel really good where we are. So I understand your question, Craig. But in general, I'm confident 
that, well, this is a great opportunity for the market.

The next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar. 

Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst 

So maybe a couple. I mean, first, from a price increase perspective, when you look at what you've done, it's a bigger part of your base that's absorbing 
the price increase than to AT&T. And despite that and the growth of wholesale cable revenues, the service revenue growth guidance was down 
and EBITDA growth was negative. 

So in terms of growth, you may need to lean on other levers, I guess, in order to grow margins beyond this year. So if you could just help us 
understand what those levers are, especially if the macro environment starts getting weaker. I mean, how do you keep your margins intact? 

And then secondly, there seems to be an enormous amount of handset inventory that you've built up over the last 2 or 3 quarters on your balance 
sheet. It would be great if you could help us understand what the objective there is, and if we should expect some kind of a clearing event around 
the holidays for those handsets. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Yes. Thank you, Kannan. First of all, when it comes to the margin, I mean, there are many levers to run here. Of course, one is, of course, continue 
to see that we have good opportunity to grow. And remember, we have 5 vectors of growth. And some of them might be more impacted if the 
economy and environment is turning worse. But many of them actually are playing well in the hands in a market like that, like fixed wireless access, 
like our value brand with TracFone and all of that. So again, I feel that we have opportunity to expand by having those performing, if it's going to 
be tougher on some others. 

And then, of course, cost. I mean, we always work with cost. And as Matt has outlined several times, we work with cost efficiency and programs 
constantly. And now we're adding efficiency programs or enhancing what we have in order to be prepared for tougher times and being able to 
invest in the market. So I think we have all the things that we should have. And I'm confident that we have a toolbox that we're working with, and 
the team is on it every day, and we will continue to be on it. 

It is an environment that's a little bit complicated, I think, for any company at the moment. But I also feel that we know what we're doing here. We 
are confident about our strategy. We are confident about our cash generation. And we are confident that we will be financially disciplined through 
this time. 

Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes, Hans, nothing really to add on the margin side. There are obviously a number of paths forward for us. And we will -- we have high expectations 
for the results we'll produce. 

On the inventory part of your question, we took a decision that, I think, was obviously a smart way of approach in the market, to say. There was 
more uncertainty around supply chain, both the availability of the physical item and also the supply chain's ability to deliver that item from factory 
to us in a predictable fashion. 

And so we've built some cushion into our supply chain model. And you can see that in the inventory levels. There is certainly scope for us as we 
feel more comfortable about the predictability of the supply chain to return inventory levels closer to historical levels is once you account for the 
difference in rates with the price of the product. But certainly, absolutely, I would expect to see inventory levels have the opportunity to reduce.

The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. 

Frank Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research 

Can you talk to us a little bit about the business market with government? And any changes you're seeing there? And then at what point can we 
expect to see the Consumer subs get back to something you're approaching a more positive growth with your current promotion strategy? Is that 
something more out into next year? I understand the confidence in the network and so forth. But at some point, we'd like to see that kind of show 
up in the subs. What can -- where can we expect that to start to turn? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Yes. Thank you, Frank. Let me start with the business -- with the government business. And of course, in government business, a little bit longer 
contracts. Of course, they come up for renovation now and then. I think what we see much more is the digitalization happens in that segment as 
well, equally much as we see with enterprises and much more about us supplying the whole -- whole business models with digitalization and 
applications and support them with the ways we're working. 

So that has been good. And as we announced yesterday, one of them, with 1 governmental agency definitely included that. So we see the government 
going the same ways as an enterprise market going with digitalization, which includes applications, wireless technology, fiber technology in order 
to see that their employees and their services have the latest technologies. And that, I think, we are playing well into, given the network we have 
and the confidence that everybody have in our network. So I think that's really what's happening. 

Matt, on the Consumer side? 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. So look, obviously, we -- the team continues to work through the competitive marketplace, as I mentioned earlier. I do expect to see a bubble 
in -- a little bit of a bubble in churn in the third quarter here because of some customer reaction to the pricing actions we've taken.

We would expect to compete effectively during the holiday season as we get into new device launches in the fourth quarter. So I would expect us 
to start to show up with obviously different numbers at that time of the year. And then we'll continue to work to be as competitive on a disciplined 
fashion in the market as we need to be. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Thanks, Frank. 

Operator 

Your final question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. 

Douglas Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD 

Hans, I think your commentary on handset subsidies is about as strong as we've heard from you. For your premium customers, do you believe then 
that streaming gives you a much better mileage for your promo dollar than handset subsidies? Or should we expect you to reconsider streaming 
subsidies as well? 

And I'm just thinking, with your new plan on the more price-conscious consumer side, is it just price that's going to swing those customers over 
to Verizon? Or is other factors like a value offering with bundled 5G home or streaming subsidy is something that might work just as well? Obviously, 
the value customers have broadband and probably have streaming at home as well. Just curious how you're thinking about evolving the price-sensitive 
offering. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you. First of all, on the different type of value services we have in the high end or in the premium segment, if it's Disney+ or others, we think 
that's very important still. And we see our customers really liking it. And we have been in the forefront of this industry with these type of exclusive 
deals with the most prominent brands you can ever think about. We will continue to do that for our high-end customers. And that has really turned 
out well for us and our partners. 

And in -- during the second half of this year as well as we announced at Investor Day, we also want to launch a +play, which is a platform for digital 
subscription aggregation for our customers. You have seen, basically, I wouldn't say everyone because there's many in the market, but the majority 
of the important brands has signed up with us. So we will continue to leverage both sort of network-as-a-service, but also distribution-as-a-service 
for our customers and for us in order to have the best return on investment. So we feel good about that. 

And as you see in the marketplace, I mean, digital subscription services is just popping up direct-to-consumer all over the place, nowhere better 
to work with than working with Verizon that has the biggest direct-to-consumer distribution in the market. So we have a lot of inbounds. We're 
going to do it right. We're going to see that our customers and our shareholders are benefiting from it. 

When it comes to the question about subsidy and all of that and segmentation, and as clearly articulated, we try to be surgical in our changes, both 
on prices and on step-ups and all of that. And right now, the team, working diligently, has been on the segment that is hitting low-end Unlimited 
and metered plan. We're going to see and have opportunities there to bundle in other things. 

We are already working with our fixed wireless access offering for our customers that are wireless customers with good -- very good value proposition. 
So we will continue that and see if there are other things we need to bundle in. But right now, we have, I think, a very strong positioning. And we 
are taking aggressive actions in the quarter, some confidence that we will continue to see improvements here over time.

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another
solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains
committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash
flow.

We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year
and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow
was $5.6 billion.

The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our
ability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband
and cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments.

Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to
the hard work and the dedication of our team.

Now let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation
and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade
levels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking
for ways to do better.

In May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns
with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped
our Verizon Consumer Group delivere notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving
higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving
our offerings to fit customers' needs.

We will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we
reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high
value they place on our services.

Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider
with elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We
are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.

Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular
decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating
the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.

On private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation
private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses,
and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.

The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our
broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable
broadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our
growth trajectory.

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We have established a high pace of customer growth, it's clear, fixed wireless access is here to stay as a proven competitive broadband product.
We are well on track to meet our target of 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers by the end of 2025 from a current base of nearly
2.3 million subscribers. We also now have an opportunity to segment the fixed wireless access market based on price, and speed tiers so that our
customers can choose the service that best suits them.

Further, we continue to see Net Promoter Scores for wireless and fixed wireless access that significantly exceed those of traditional cable offerings.
We have the best network in the market. In the next couple of quarters, we will extend our lead with a last tranche of the C-band spectrum. For the
31st time in a row, Verizon was the most awarded brand for wireless network quality in J.D. Power's U.S. Wireless Network Quality Study, no other
wireless provider has achieved this, and for 2023, we received top scores among all J.D. Power Study Factors in all 6 regions.

Additionally, our team continues to innovate within our network, upgrading our infrastructure around the country and successfully testing our
ability to slice our 5G network. Slicing will allow us to serve customers with dedicated 5G service on a large scale and to meet the diverse needs of
the largest base of wireless customers in the United States.

Next, I want to address the recent news about the legacy lead cable in our network. We take this matter seriously, and to be very clear, lead
infrastructure makes up a small percentage of our copper network, and we began phasing away from installing new lead cable by the 1950s. At
Verizon, the communities we serve and our employees are at the heart of everything we do, and we're using a fact and science-based approach
in our assessment. You will hear more on the topic from Tony later on.

Our accelerated plans for efficiency with our new structure, which we put in place over the last couple of quarters are already paying off. Verizon
Global Services has taken action on a number of opportunities company-wide, realizing significant savings by focusing on IT platform transformation,
leveraging artificial intelligence, rationalizing our real estate portfolio, and improving our supply chains.

We're on track to achieve our forecasted $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2025, these savings in combination with the completion of
the $10 billion C-band spend position us to generate strong cash flow and continue to invest in our business and pursue dividend increases as we
execute on our capital allocation strategy.

Now I will turn the call over to Tony to discuss our operations and financial performance in more detail.

Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the second quarter demonstrate our progress towards our 3 priorities of growing wireless service
revenue, delivering healthy consolidated adjusted EBITDA and increasing free cash flow. Our focus on execution is working and we remain on track
to meet our financial guidance for 2023.

We are happy with our progress, but we have more work to do. We are focused on continuing to improve our performance while remaining
financially disciplined. In the second quarter, our consumer segment demonstrated better operating results both sequentially and year-over-year
in postpaid phone net adds.

Additionally, we experienced continued strong performance within our business segment both in terms of mobility and FWA subscriber growth.
The results reflect the benefits of our ongoing C-band deployment and improved go-to-market execution. Consumer postpaid phone net losses
totaled 136,000 for the quarter compared to 215,000 net losses in the second quarter of 2022.

Consumer postpaid phone gross adds were strong once again up 6.9% year-over-year, driven by new to Verizon gross adds, which increased
approximately 19% over the prior year period. We also saw notable growth in consumer postpaid ARPA which was up 6.2% year-over-year. The
recent launch of myPlan reflects a more segmented and targeted approach. While it's still early, myPlan is driving a significantly higher premium
mix with nearly 70% of myPlan customers taking the Unlimited Plus option.

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We are also encouraged by the step activity we are seeing. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.76%, up 1 basis point compared
with the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn drove the year-over-year increase, offsetting a modest improvement in voluntary churn.
Our involuntary churn rates remain at pre-pandemic levels and were flat for the third consecutive quarter.

It is important to note our performance in existing C-band markets. In the 46 markets where we initially deployed C-band, postpaid phone gross
add growth was more than 100 basis points higher in the quarter than in non-C-band markets. Additionally, phone churn was 4 basis points lower
in C-band markets, and our premium mix in C-band markets was 11 percentage points higher.

Let's now look at our business results. Verizon business once again delivered solid performance and continues to expand on its industry-leading
wireless market share. Demand continues to be strong in all 3 customer groups resulting in 144,000 phone net adds for the second quarter compared
to 227,000 for the same period last year, which benefited from some large deals. As Hans mentioned, this marks the eighth consecutive quarter
where we have delivered over 125,000 business phone net adds.

We continue to win high-value business based on the strength of our network performance and value proposition. Notably, we had a recent
government contract win where we took share from 2 of our competitors at attractive ARPUs.

Moving on to broadband, we maintain our strong performance with 418,000 total broadband net additions in the second quarter. In the past 4
quarters, we've added more than 1.6 million broadband subscribers, growing our total broadband subscriber base by more than 21% during that
time. Growth in FWA remained healthy with 384,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in the prior year period. We now have nearly 2.3 million customers
on our FWA product that we expect growth to continue at a fairly similar pace in the third quarter.

On the Fios side, Internet net adds for the second quarter were 54,000, up from 36,000 in the second quarter of last year. Despite continued softness
in household move activity, gross adds rose year-over-year and our retention levels continue to be strong. Our value market team continues to
take steps to address some of the softness we saw in the first half of the year.

Prepaid net losses totaled 304,000 in the second quarter. Our year-to-date net add performance should represent a low point as we continue to
make progress integrating TracFone while taking actions to better position us for growth including scaling our visible and total by Verizon brands.
As Hans mentioned, we expect to see sequential improvements beginning in the third quarter.

Let's now look at our financials, starting with consolidated revenue for the quarter, which was $32.6 billion, down 3.5% year-over-year. The decline
can be attributed to reduced wireless equipment revenue which was nearly 21% lower than the prior year as postpaid phone upgrade activity
declined 34% versus the same period last year.

Service and other revenue grew 0.8%, driven by wireless service revenue growth. Total wireless service revenue was $19.1 billion, up 3.8%
year-over-year and more than $200 million sequentially. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from pricing actions including a recent
change to our Verizon Mobile Protect offering. Additionally, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue
into wireless service revenue and growth in fixed wireless access drove revenue improvements. These benefits were partially offset by continued
pressure from the amortization of handset promotions.

We are on track to deliver our wireless service revenue guidance for the year. We continue to assess opportunities to take targeted pricing actions
to better monetize our products and services as we deliver great value for our customers. For example, we recently announced an increase in our
FWA bundled pricing for new customers which we expect will provide service revenue benefits in the second half of the year.

Additionally, we expect less pressure from the amortization of promotional costs in the second half of the year given the softer upgrade environment
and our disciplined approach to promotional spending.

Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12 billion, up 0.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 160 basis
points over the prior year, primarily driven by lower consumer postpaid upgrade volumes and improved service revenue.

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

These benefits were partially offset by higher marketing expenses in the quarter related to the myPlan launch as well as a $194 million increase in
bad debt year-over-year. Bad debt was relatively flat from the prior quarter and payment trends remain consistent with recent quarters and
prepandemic levels.

Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items were down 5.9% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of
equipment from reduced upgrade volumes. As Hans mentioned, we continue to execute on our cost savings program, including through initiatives
within our Verizon Global Services organization.

During the quarter, we took actions to rationalize our workforce as we continue to see benefits from rationalizing certain legacy wireline products.
We are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million of savings this year from our transformation efforts and continue to make progress towards
achieving our goal of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual cost savings by 2025.

Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter was $9.7 billion, and for the first half of the year totaled $18 billion compared to $17.7
billion in the prior year period. The increase continues to be related to working capital improvements associated with lower inventory levels and
fewer upgrades which were offset in part by higher cash income taxes and interest expense.

CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, which reflects the completion of our $10 billion accelerated C-band program. Capital spending for
the first half of the year totaled $10.1 billion, which was over $400 million less than last year. We continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be
within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion.

Our peak capital spend is behind us, and we are now at a business-as-usual run rate for CapEx which we expect will continue into 2024. The net
result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $5.6 billion. Free cash flow for the first half of the year
is $8 billion and nearly $800 million improvement from the previous year, driven by a combination of our lower CapEx spend compared to the
prior year and operating cash flow benefits previously mentioned.

While we do not normally guide on free cash flow, our strong results give us a clear line of sight to more than $17 billion of free cash flow for the
full year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.6 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the end of the previous
quarter and $4.1 billion lower year-over-year.

We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash on hand. We are well positioned with respect to our unsecured debt maturities with no remaining
obligations for the rest of the year. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x as of the end of the second quarter a
0.1x improvement both sequentially and year-over-year.

We continue to monitor the current interest rate environment closely given the recent comments from the Federal Reserve on planned rate increases
later in the year. As previously stated, we expect higher interest expense to impact our full year earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30, and there's
no change to that view. Our strong second quarter results support our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged.

Before I hand the call back to Hans, I'd like to address the recent media reports on lead-sheathed cables in our network. Here is what we currently
know. We still have some lead-sheathed cable in our copper network. As a result of the age of this infrastructure and the history of the industry,
records are incomplete as to exactly how much of the cable on our network has lead sheathing.

However, to give you a sense of the scale of the infrastructure we are talking about, our copper network is comprised of less than 540,000 miles of
cable, roughly half of which is aerial and lead-sheathed cable makes up a small percentage of our copper network. This number excludes the
network elements previously owned by MCI and XO Communications because we are still reviewing the historical records of those companies.

We're not disturbed the likelihood of exposure to lead from lead-sheathed cables is low. In addition, because the lead-sheathed cable was used as
a feeder and distribution cable and does not run into individual homes or apartments it is generally in locations that minimize the potential for
public contact.

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We are working with a third-party expert to conduct our own testing at our sites that were identified by the media. We will not have the results of
our testing for several weeks. When we have the results of our testing, we will work closely with our industry and others to address any concerns
and issues.

Now I think it's important to address the question we've received from a lot of investors, which is about the process for and potential cost of removal
of the lead-sheathed cable in our network. Given where we are in this process, it is far too soon to make any projection on what the potential
financial impact might be to the company.

There are a number of unknowns in this area, including whether there is a health risk presented by undisturbed lead sheathed cable and if there
is a risk, how that risk should be addressed. As a result, we do not believe there's a meaningful way to estimate any potential cost to the company
or that any such estimate would even be useful. We won't be able to provide any additional color during the Q&A session, as we have more
information we can share on the topic, we will certainly do that.

I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Tony. As we pass the midpoint of 2023, I'm pleased by how we are effectively delivered on our priorities, and I'm confident that we will
meet the financial goals we set for ourselves for the full year.

To summarize, in mobility, our segmented and disciplined approach to the market is working, and our efforts to improve the Consumer Group's
performance will continue throughout the second half of the year.

In broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning as we capitalize on the unique strength and capabilities of both
technologies. We continue to have the best network in the market, and our leadership position will only get stronger as we continue to roll out
C-band. While we're encouraged by the quarter's results. There's more work to be done. My leadership team and I are laser-focused on delivering
what we committed to you at top of the year. Strong wider service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow as well as meeting our 203 financial guidance.

By that, I hand it over to Brady for questions.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take the first question.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Looks like a nice beat on the consumer side, really driven by the postpaid ARPA growth of about 6%. Could you guys sort of pull that apart a little
bit and maybe talk about the sustainability of that and the service revenue growth you saw as we head into the second half.

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

I mean I think you've got some lap, some price increases, but you've got some other price increases coming through and some of the promotional
stuff rolling off. And then maybe just quickly on the lead. Obviously, you guys can't quantify it, but when you guys say low single -- low exposure
of the 540,000 miles of copper, is that single digit? Can you guys tighten up that number for us a little bit? That would be great.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, John. Let me start with the service revenue. I think we have been extremely focused on the service revenue. As you see in this quarter,
we are expanding the growth from the first quarter, but it's many components, I understand you want to know a little bit more about the ARPA
expansion, but we definitely see the broadband is adding to our growth.

And then, of course, our wireless business side is doing extremely well as well. I mean 8 quarters, more than 125,000. So we're actually doing a lot
of things in different areas. But then if you go to the Consumer Group, they have been really good the last couple of quarters right now to be
segmenting, targeting the right offering with the right pricing for the customers.

And myPlan has been playing in very well to that. And as you heard Tony talking about 70% of taking the premium plan. So -- but that's just the
start of it. We're not done. But clearly, I'm confident that the team knows how to manage this, given how much we invested in research on the
consumer side to understand our consumers better and that's why we launched myPlan.

So all in all, I have to say the guys are doing well, but I'm confident we will continue on this stride. But maybe Tony can give you some more on
that, and then we can come back to the lead.

Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans. So on the service revenue, we're very confident in the guide. You mentioned tough comps that we face in the second half. When
you think about the second half of the year, let me unpack some of the drivers for you.

As you know, we executed a number of targeted pricing actions between the price ups on the legacy unlimited plans that we did earlier in the
quarter as well as most recently, changes to our handset insurance program and price changes on FWA bundles.

Secondly, we had the introduction of myPlan back in May. That's helped with premium mix, and you heard that we're roughly 70% taking the
Unlimited Plus plan. As Hans mentioned, we see an increase in contribution from fixed wireless access. We have 2.3 million subs in the base, and
we have great momentum on FWA.

And then fourth, we see continued improvements in year-over-year consumer postpaid volumes, and you saw that in the quarter. And then lastly,
when you think about the promo amortization, the revenue impact from promotions and the promo amortization has decelerated in recent quarters.
And that's -- it's basically a function of our disciplined approach to promotions and retention. So when you put that all together, we're very confident
that all the initiatives here will continue to drive meaningful revenue growth in the second half.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

On the lead, as I said, we take this matter very seriously. And we're doing exactly what you expect from Verizon. We're doing this scientific and
fact-based whereas Tony said, we're going over the different places that were pointed out by media and doing our own measurements with internal
and external experts. And that's where we are. And we will do this very thorough. We are always doing things thorough. We do it fact-based,
scientific and that's how we're going to do. And that's what you should expect from us.

Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And John, we're still reviewing the records, and we mentioned that we're still reviewing the historical records of the former MCI and XO network.
So that work is still ongoing as well. So we still have more work to do there. And as we learn more, we'll keep you updated.

Operator

The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD

I think I'll follow up on consumer volumes you alluded to in responding to John. It was great to see the consumer phone losses improve year-over-year,
but I know your ambition is to do better than that. How do you think about the path getting back to net growth in consumer postpaid phones, do
you think you're going to need to take further actions in terms of the product mix or pricing or even any additional internal adjustments? Or do
you think you have the places -- pieces in place, and it's really just a matter of driving better execution against that framework.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I think it's about execution on the framework we have built right now. The guys have everything. Sampath and the team together with Tony and
me with the full support. We have a new platform in myPlan. We have segmented above the market. We work with financial discipline. The target
we have for our team is continue to do sequential growth. And as Sampath and the team said before, we -- ultimately, we want our fair share also
on the net adds.

But ultimately, we measure ourselves on service revenue growth. And as you can see, we continue to improve that. So it's more about now executing
on this being patient and see that both the network is the best in the market, but it's just improving and some of the numbers that Tony talked
about, you see the impact we have when the C-band is coming out.

And then myPlan. You see also see that is now initially what we have talked about is actually giving us really good confidence that we're in the
right place. So all that is in place. And then we do the regionalization as well at the same time. So a lot of things is in place. It's more about execution
and doing it with a financial discipline that you should expect from Verizon.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD

And how do we think about a time line for getting to sustainably positive net adds in consumer. Is that something that would be a reasonable
expectation once you have C-band fully deployed?

Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Brett, it's Tony. So volumes are important to the business. And as we said before, we're going to be very disciplined on how we approach the market.
Our focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. It's too soon to call third quarter positive for consumer. But as we said, we expect
improvements year-over-year in consumer net adds and the team and Sampath and the team are very focused on that.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks Brett. Brad, we are ready for next question.

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

I wanted to come back to the second phase of C-band. It was helpful to get those statistics. Could you just help us a little bit more in terms of what
this is going to mean in terms of your footprint, both on the wireless side and on the fixed wireless side, how do we think that's going to help both
coverage and also capacity.

I know there's concerns in some quarters about fixed wireless facing congestion. It would be great to let us know what your experience has been
with usage and how you feel good about handling that 4 million to 5 million and beyond over the next few years?

And then maybe a quick one for Tony. Obviously, the stock has been under some pressure here, pretty high yield. Perhaps remind us about how
you're thinking about potentially going to buybacks. You're seeing some deleveraging now strong free cash flow. Is that going to be an option
here in the not-too-distant future.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Simon. When it comes to the C-band, I said we're ahead of the plan. As soon as we get hold of the next tranche of spectrum, the team
is ready to continue to deploy that. That's going to give us both more capacity, but of course, more coverage as well. So it gave us both. And as
you have seen in the numbers we talk about here, as soon as we deploy C-band, we get better uptake from our wireless customers. And of course,
we'll open up fixed wireless access. So that should be positive over time for us.

And when it comes to this lingering question about capacity, we don't have any capacity problems. I mean the guys are doing an enormously good
job as always when it comes to Verizon and capacity, network planning. Joe and the team are on it all the time and seeing that we're doing the
right for our customers.

And remember, we are building a multipurpose network. That means that we have one radio that serve multiple opportunities, wireless, fixed
wireless access, in some cases, private networks, so all that is in one, and that's the efficiency and the scale we're bringing right now, which we
expected when we started with 5G and the C-band to see that we get the leverage model over time. But of course, it's going to roll out on the next
year here. So I'm confident that this will create more opportunities for us now when we get hold of the next tranche of the C-band spectrum.

Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Okay, Simon. And then on your question on the cash generation, we're very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash on hand at the
end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which was very strong and reflective of our strong free cash flow results that it is higher -- running higher than
normal. As a reminder, we do have about $4.5 billion of the C-band clearing obligations remaining and due soon, and that's obviously a priority
for us.

The cash generation, as I said, is strong, gives us optionality and supports a much improved dividend payout ratio. Our capital allocation priorities
are unchanged. We said, first, we would invest in the business. The second priority is our commitment to the dividend. Our third priority is to
delever, and you'll see us be focused on that. And then once we get to the leverage metric of 2.25, we will consider buybacks at that time.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Simon, Brad, we are ready for next question.

The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

With the price increases and the impact of the new pricing structure, it looks like you're trending above the midpoint of service revenue growth. I
mean, it could be closer to the high end. Any reason to think it decelerates from here?

And then second, Hans, you spoke on private wireless. Can you dig into the market opportunity there? And how long it takes for that to be a $1
billion business?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I'll start with the second question, and Tony can come back on the first. On the private wireless, what we have found out during the work we've
been doing is that private 5G networks is something really, really valuable for enterprises and SMBs. And the main reason is that the capacity on
it, the speed and the security, it basically starts as a Wi-Fi replacement on licensed spectrum. And then you start adding on to it.

Usually it start with one factory. And if you see that are working there, they do it in all factories. We have a growing list of new customers coming
in, in the first phase. I would say this is a new business for us that again, is building on the same investment, the same Verizon Intelligent Edge
Network. I don't expect that it's $1 billion business this year. But it definitely over time, this is a very important lever for Kyle and his team for growth
in the service revenue and actually doing even better in the -- with enterprises.

So it's going to take some time, but I'm really pleased with what I've seen in the last couple of quarters, how this is turning out. And I would say we
have now an ecosystem with devices, with radio base stations, with integrators and all of that, which we haven't had before. So I'm more optimistic
than a long time that private networks will be something. And as you know, I mean, we were way ahead of anybody else on this field. And that's
why I feel really confident we will take more than our fair share.

Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Phil. And then on the service revenue, as we mentioned upfront, we have some tough comps as we lap the price up from last year. We do expect
sequential improvements in the third quarter. One thing to note, just on the prepaid revenue, we did see a headwind in the quarter of about $125
million. I would expect that to be at a similar level in the third quarter before it eases up in the fourth quarter, that's probably one additional data
point for you.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Frank Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research

Can you walk us through the correlation between the broadband adds and the business wireless adds, including both the Fios and fixed wireless?
And then you mentioned expecting some software upgrades. Are you anticipating having to subsidize any more for handsets to get adds as the
year goes on?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

On the broadband side, I think I got the question like that the correlation between the fixed wireless access and the Fios. I mean, let me say that
on the fixed wireless access right now, we are growing that base, of course, mainly outside the ILEC because that's just how it is because the Fios
is so strong. So we're doing great on the Fios business. And as you have seen, even though it's a softer housing movement season than before,
we're doing great. I mean, over 50,000 again on Fios. So Fios is doing really well.

And then, of course, we have a portion of converged customers that is now growing. It's not growing that to come to European levels or something,
but it's growing. The good thing for us is we have owner's economics on everything, fixed wireless access, wireless, Fios, we have one network, we
are our own fiber. And that, of course, gives us opportunity to meet customer demands if they want convergence or not and that nobody else has
in the industry. So really pleased with the development of broadband for us. We outlined this as one of the most important 5G innovations we've
done.

We have substantial new customers there. So this is a great opportunity and as you saw right now we continue doing as we have done. I mean we
have now 2.3 [million] (corrected by company after the call) customers on fixed wireless access. We can now start with different tiers, different
pricings, so we can meet customer demands that have different requirements. And that's just good for us, but it's also really good for our customers
because they can choose between different models, depending on what needs they have.

Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And the only other thing I would add is that we have a great rhythm at 400,000 broadband net adds in the quarter. And again, another -- the
third consecutive quarter of over 400,000 broadband net adds, and we continue to see good momentum with customers taking -- wireless customers
taking FWA and we see great progress there as well.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

And then you had a question on upgrades. And as you have seen, and promos. That is clearly down in the second quarter and the first quarter as
well. There are many reasons where some are, of course, that we are much more financially disciplined. That's very important. But it also haven't
been in any major new devices coming out.

It will probably come on in the second half. It usually comes, so we're going to see that. But I don't foresee that we will come back to the levels
we've seen before from a point of view of Verizon. We think that we're going to be disciplined. We're going to offer devices and promos and
upgrades where there is the best for the segment and for the customer, but will not come back to the levels that we saw before.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

So I wanted to come back to the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry. Before the lead, this was the big issue. And if there were 2
pillars to the idea behind the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry, one was that somehow Verizon had negotiated a deal with the
cable industry that they would guarantee to make money no matter how much data cable consumers took.

And the second was that, that deal would never end. It was going to be forever. And so I feel like the messaging on that has started to change from
Verizon a little bit and that maybe that the idea that cable industry is guaranteed to make money in the relationship between Verizon and cable
regardless of data consumption, that that's not true.

And then this deal isn't permanent, it could change at some future time, even though the DOJ, obviously, you need to have a some deal, but it
doesn't have to be this deal. And I was wondering if you could kind of just address that for us right now.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

David, thank you for the question. This is a complex area. And remember, many of these things we cannot talk about. We have NDA's when it comes
to our contracts. The only thing that I'm securing is that Verizon is making money on this, that's I can tell you, and we think this is an important
business. These are important customers to us.

And again, I go back to what I talked about before. We build the network once. The more connections and more usage and the more revenue we
have on it, the better return on capital it is. And as long as we see that's happening, we will continue the work we're doing, however, I cannot go
into specifics on the contracts because, first of all, I'm not allowed to do it. So -- but clearly, you should feel confident that Verizon is doing that
with the best interest of our stakeholders and our shareholders. So -- and we want to get the best return on our invested capital in the network.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for next question.

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Two questions, if I could. First, just following up on the comments around tiering of fixed wireless and potentially on speed, is there also an
opportunity to begin tiering mobile 5G wireless in terms of megabits per second rather than a historical way of tiering on gigabytes per month of
consumption?

And then just secondly, you mentioned that the cash CapEx is tracking to guidance. But just curious, as you're deploying the mid-band spectrum,
the depth of it, and seeing what the propagation is, are there opportunities to get further efficiencies in capital and potentially go below the
business as usual indication of CapEx for 2024.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Mike, thank you for the question. On the question about different models over time, how we can charge for 5G., I think we find a good model within
myPlan right now with different type of network options, then you can take your perks. All of it is accretive for us. You should see the first sort of
launch here as the first time we come out with the platform.

We see multiple opportunities, how you can sort of diverse that one in different ways to meet different customer demands. So you will probably
see more of that going forward, how we'll do that. So clearly, very important to us that we continue to meet our customers with new plans and
things like that. But now we have a great base that is myPlan.

On the CapEx side, I think we have gone over sort of a fairly long hump here coming from Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, investing in fiber,
investing to -- in all the parts of millimeter wave, then coming into the hump of C-band, now we come into the BAU. As far as we can see right now,
is BAU is around $17 billion to $17.5 billion. And that's going to see that we can deploy the C-band, getting all the benefits we talked about is
coming down. Fiber is more success-based. So there's a lot of things happening in there, but we're really confident that we can be on those levels,
and our team is really doing a great job.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Mike. Brad, we are ready for next question.

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst

Two questions, if I could. First, if I could return to the lead topic for one moment. Can you just talk about the extent to which you used overlashing
of fiber to what might potentially be lead cables particularly in your aerial plant in the Northeast.

And then second, I just wonder if you could just help us think about the trajectory going forward of fixed wireless, which has seemingly sort of
steadied out to a relatively stable number. Is that what we should expect because that would take us a bit higher than your guidance by the end
of 2025. So I'm just wondering how we think about the pacing of fixed wireless.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Craig. I'll start with the fixed wireless access question because I think that is an important one. And the lead, we will hear from Tony on
that one. On the fixed wireless access, you're right. I mean we are now running on a fairly high level, adding broadband subscriber quarter. Remember,
-- we have defined -- we are roughly in, I would say, a little bit over 70% of the PAs of C-band so far out of 402, so that, of course, is how many OFS
or open for sales, we can do right now. So that is a little bit -- the next step is going to be the next tranche coming in.

And I said, we're well ahead for the 4 million to 5 million, the team is doing a great job. We also saw that we now are doing some great work on
how we can address MDUs in a very efficient way. We're in the beginning of that. So all in all, I think that fixed wireless access and how we're
managing our network is going great. And of course, as an ambitious leader, as I am, I expect that we can do better, of course. But right now, that's
the forecast we have, 4 million to 5 million. And we are really doing well. And the customer satisfaction on fixed wireless access is so good. It's so
simple. You install it yourself. You get broadband immediately.

So we're just meeting a consumer demand that no one else is doing basically. So I'm really pleased with the product. We talked about this being
one of the most important 5G applications, and now you can see what it means to us and how important it's going to be over time.

And then, Craig, on the lead, as we said earlier, it's a small part of our network. It's about 50% aerial. We said we're still reviewing the historical
records, both former MCI network and the former XO copper network. So we still have work to do there. We're going to take a very methodical
approach, very fact-based, very scientific-based approach. And as we know everyone wants more information. And as we learn more, we'll keep
you updated.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Craig. Brad, we are ready for next question.

Operator

The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank.

Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Senior Analyst

I want to ask 2, if I could. I guess, First, just on the lead issue, I was wondering if you thought this might lead to an acceleration in copper network
retirements and therefore, an accelerated reduction in fixed costs for legacy networks. It seems like an opportunity in cases where communities
might want to not have lead cable in their communities, even if it isn't actually shedding any lead.

And then secondly, I just had a follow-up to Simon's question earlier. Can you talk about how the remaining C-band deployments will affect the
fixed wireless opportunity in rural areas? Specifically, how much of an expansion in the rural footprint will that represent versus the available
footprint today for fixed wireless, and would that include a lot of areas that aren't served by anything today, except for copper infrastructure, so
kind of the true rural areas?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So on the first one, we have always a plan for network transformation that we continue going. That has not changed. When it comes to this
lead-sheathed cables discussion, as said, I mean, we're going to go through this scientific, we're going to do test. We're going to do it fact-based
and then we'll come back. But we have a normal network transformation that we constantly do because Kyle and team are doing that in order to
keep up with the pressure of the secular decline in wireline, so he will continue to do that, and we do that all the time.

On the second question on fixed wireless access, yes, of course, when we -- the first 70, i would say ish, I would say is C-band mark PEAs that is
called, they are mainly in urban areas. And that's where we have had that good traction on fixed wireless access. In the next step, it's going to be
much more suburban and rural. And of course, that's great opportunity because usually, they are even less different options for customers in those
areas.

So of course, that's going to create opportunities for us. That doesn't mean that we are changing our guidance. We still say 4 million to 5 million
by 2025. Of course, the team is always driving hard here, and I am driving hard. We always want to achieve. We want to show our stakeholders that
we are a great company and we execute well, which I think we're doing. So definitely, we see opportunities coming with the next tranche of C-band.

The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

On the wholesale -- on the cable side, maybe just discuss the wholesale wireless ARPUs broadly speaking. Do you think you can grow wholesale
wireless ARPUs. And then the $10 increase in fixed wireless pricing, do you think that would slow kind of sub growth quarterly, obviously good
strength there? And then lastly, on the lead side, can you just qualitatively talk how often are your workers exposed to lead? I'm sure you have to
log that. And what do you do to kind of protect workers? And have you ever seen any claims from workers on lead poisoning.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

There were many questions in all there. So let me start by the change of discounts that we did on fixed wireless access again, we have a premium
product. We have different type of optionalities for our customers in order to pick and choose with the best areas or what the best service is. So
we think that this is just natural when you have passed over 2 million subscribers on fixed wireless access.

And I think you just think about when we started with unlimited, you start with one plan and then you start to work with different segmentation
because ultimately, we are in a very, very big consumer business, where so many differentiated customers that needs different type of services. So
just think about it as a very natural step for us in order to serve our customers in a good way. Then I hand it over to Tony for the next question.

Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the cable partnership, I mean, as Hans mentioned, we don't go into the details. I mean, we continue to see volume growth in the relationship,
and we're very satisfied with the relationship and we continue to monetize the network, as Hans said earlier.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

And then on the worker lead exposure?

Anthony Skiadas - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

We continue to work across the company and continue to take a methodical approach. We're not going to get into any specifics around employees
or anything. But as we said, we'll keep you posted as we learn more.

Peter Supino - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior Analyst

I wanted to ask 2, one on upgrade rates and the other on FWA. On upgrade rates, I wondered if you could discuss why they've fallen so much. And
whether it's sustainable what the risks are to a recent trend and on FWA. I just wonder if you could discuss the service price increase that we learned
about this week.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

On the upgrade rates, as I said before, I mean, first of all, we at Verizon has been very disciplined in how to offer sort of products and services with
the right price at the right time. So definitely that has been that we are actually doing less promos and less upgrades, that has not hampered our
way of growing our business or taking customers, and we will continue to work with that.

Then, of course, hasn't been any major product coming out in the market. We expect there's going to be a product coming out in the second half.
We're excited over that. And of course, that's going to drive upgrades and promos, of course. But again, we will continue to be very financially
disciplined. But of course, we're excited for these type of things as it attracts store traffic. And when store traffic comes we are really good and
having a good conversion rate, adding things to it to our customers, which is really, really important.

And then second, on the fixed wireless access, taking away the discount, and again, we come to a level of 2.3 million fixed wireless customer. There
are so many different type of customers and consumers we have. So of course, having different tiers and pricing becomes very normal in order to
meet customer demands. So it's just how we do, and that will continue to do and see how the market is developing.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Brad, we have time for one more question.

Operator

The final question for today will come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed.

Walter Piecyk - LightShed Partners, LLC - Partner & TMT Analyst

I just want to actually do a follow-up to that upgrade question. The last 2 years, Hans, the upgrade rate has actually declined in the third quarter.
So I just want to kind of piece meal together, like you said you're not going to do handset promotions earlier in the call.

Obviously, everyone knows Apple comes out with a new product, but in the last answer, it sounded like you thought people would upgrade more,
but what, what seasonal trends should we see here? I assume you're still expecting it to be down year-on-year, but what about sequentially because
it's been typically down sequentially in the third quarter for the last 2 quarters, maybe COVID had some impact on that, I don't know.

And then my second question on CapEx. There's some debate, I think a lot of the tower companies specifically are trying to drive this narrative of
like, oh, your C-band is going to get deployed, but they're doing fixed wireless and all these things, you're going to have to come back and do
densification very quickly.

So any lull in CapEx will be short-lived. I'm just curious, I mean, obviously, we saw the CapEx drop very quickly here in this quarter. How long do
you think this kind of CapEx holiday will exist before you need to come back and use densification in the absence of additional spectrum sourced
by the FCC?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thank you. On the upgrade, I cannot -- I don't know anything about any launch of the product, how exciting it's going to be. But ultimately,
that usually drives more upgrades. So let's see what's going to happen this time and when it comes out. But we're always excited to see Apple
coming out with a new phone. Hopefully, they are coming in this half. I cannot reveal what they are doing. But clearly, we're excited for that.

On the CapEx, yes, you should talk to us. We know more about this than other companies. I would say we have a really good, sustainable level of
this densification, it's part of our strategy already. So -- and many of the things that we're already are deploying on C-band, we deploy sort of for
the full spectrum already from the beginning, then we turn on when we get those tranches.

So there's a lot of things that my team has done over years in order to be as efficient as possible on CapEx. That's why I feel really good on our sort
of BAU around $17 billion to $17.5 billion. I feel really good about that because we go through this extremely detailed. So we feel confident.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Walt. Brad, that was all the time we had for today.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Before Fran reviews the third-quarter results, I would like to highlight a few items from our quarterly earnings. For the third quarter of 2016, we
reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several significant nonoperational items that I would like to
highlight.

Our reported earnings include a non-cash pretax loss of $797 million. The pretax pension remeasurement adjustment due to settlement accounting
resulted in a $555 million charge, and severance costs related to existing separation plans amounted to $242 million. The net impact after tax
approximated $500 million or $0.12 per share.

In third-quarter 2015, earnings included $0.05 per share of a non-cash charge due to pension remeasurement. Excluding the effect of these
nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter, a decline of 2.9% compared with $1.04 per share a year ago.

Additionally in the quarter we executed on our first on-balance-sheet asset-backed securitization transactions totaling $2.6 billion.

The cash flow statement reflects asset-backed securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. This captioning
impacts the free cash flow metric, but overall net cash available remains unchanged relative to off-balance-sheet securitization. We plan to continue
to securitize equipment receivables with on-balance-sheet financings in future periods.

With that I will now turn the call over to Fran.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2016 continues to be a transformational year for us, just as we had
outlined over a year ago. During this transformation we are executing on a very challenging competitive environment, investing and positioning
for the future growth, and returning value to our shareholders.

Competitive activity in the wireless market increased during the third quarter as expected, and we responded in a measured way to grow and
retain our valuable customer base by introducing new wireless plans and disciplined promotions.

We have been successful in retaining our high-value postpaid smartphone base and improving service revenue trends. In the Wireline market, we
returned to a strong quarter of execution following the strike that impacted the second quarter. We grew our Fios base and improved the consumer
revenue trend.

We are focused on continuously improving our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. This execution
enabled us to deliver overall strong margins and adjusted earnings per share.

We remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation that consists of investing for growth, returning value to shareholders, and preserving our
strong balance sheet. Our investments are consistent with our three-tier strategy, starting with investing in our network by expanding our wireless
capacity and pre-positioning for future growth in both 4G and 5G.

We continue to lead in all third-party measures for network performance and reliability. We are investing in new growth businesses in digital media
technology to extend our ability to monetize the usage on our networks and create new revenue streams from advertising, content rights, telematics
and other IoT solutions.

In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.2% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.31 per share. This was
the 10th consecutive year that our Board has approved a dividend increase, endorsing their confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and
returning value to our shareholders.

Let's move to third-quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on slide 6. Our third-quarter results highlight our
ability to execute in a challenging environment and drive strong operating and financial results. On a reported basis, total operating revenue

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

decreased 6.7% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of the three Wireline markets to Frontier, which closed on April 1,
2016, and the Wireless commercial pricing model change. Excluding the impact of Wireline divestiture, consolidated revenue was down 2.9%.

In terms of Wireless revenue, the service revenue trend was on track with our expectations for the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to
unsubsidized price plans and optimization of our current customers to the new pricing plans. Equipment revenue, which started the quarter slowly
due to low volumes, ended strong with the introduction of the iPhone 7. Wireline revenue trends were consistent with previous quarters.

Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.3 billion, up 1%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5%, up 140 basis points in the quarter. We
remain focused on enhancing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the
business, which we expect will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.

Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 7. Cash flows from operations were $4.8 billion in the third quarter. Keep in mind as we
shift to the asset-backed securitization model, there is $2.6 billion of cash that is reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement, while
in prior periods under the off-balance-sheet securitization model this funding would have flowed through cash flow from operations.

Free cash flow for the nine months of the year totaled $6.2 billion, which was impacted by our on-balance-sheet securitization transactions. Cash
taxes for the quarter were higher compared to a year ago, primarily due to transaction tax payments of $2.4 billion. This amount represented the
majority of total taxes due for the gain on the sale of our Wireline operations to Frontier earlier this year. The remainder is expected to be paid next
quarter.

The increase was also affected by certain benefits that we realized in prior periods which did not occur in this period. Capital expenditures were
$4.1 billion in the quarter, driven by increased spending in Wireless for densification and in Wireline for Fios installations, as volumes expanded
post-work stoppage.

We now expect full-year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the low end of the range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. We ended the quarter with
$106.6 billion of total debt, which includes $2.6 billion of asset-backed securitization debt, net debt of $100.2 billion, and a ratio of net debt to
adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 times.

The net debt includes the asset-backed securitization debt. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to
2019 timeframe.

Now let's move into reviews of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide 8.

Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.2% for the quarter, compared to a decline of 5.4% in the second quarter. Service revenue plus installment
billings increased 2.3% to $19.3 billion in the third quarter. Service revenue trends are consistent with our expectations as the postpaid base
migrates to the unsubsidized price plans.

We now have approximately 60% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We continue to expect that we will return to
year-over-year service revenue growth by the end of 2017.

Equipment revenue was $4.1 billion, down 3.9% due to lower equipment volumes. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans
was about 70% in the third quarter compared with about 67% in the second quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the
fourth quarter to be around 70%, given the higher seasonal consumer mix of volumes.

During the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we have about 35.8 million phone connections activated
on a device payment plan, representing 41% of our postpaid phone base.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Total Wireless operating revenues decreased 3.9% in the quarter to $22.1 billion. The cost structure in Wireless continues to improve, driven by
streamlining of business process improvements in distribution, care, and supply chain, resulting in higher digital customer contact and lower
transaction costs.

In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, flat with last year, and we had a segment EBITDA margin of
44.9%, up 170 basis points from 43.2%.

Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on slide 9.

Total postpaid net adds, which we do not include any wholesale connections including Internet of Things, totaled 442,000. Within the postpaid
net additions, we added 357,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline of 3G smartphones, resulting in
242,000 net new high-quality smartphones.

Overall, net phone additions were a negative 36,000 due to the offset of basic phones and softer phone gross additions. Tablet net additions totaled
221,000. All other postpaid net additions totaled 257,000, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver.

Postpaid gross additions were 3.8 million, down from 4.2 million and up slightly from last quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.04%, up 11 basis
points, driven by tablet churn. As we have previously discussed, we expect this higher rate of tablet churn to continue into the first half of next
year as two-year agreements associated with prior tablet promotional offers roll off.

We continue to see strong retention in our retail postpaid phone base. Postpaid phone churn was up 2 basis points from a year ago and remained
below 0.90% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Net prepaid additions increased to 83,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement
sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new price plans for our prepaid market.

We ended the quarter with 113.7 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection
base grew 3% to 108.2 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.5 million. Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on
slide 10.

Total postpaid device activations were 10.7 million in the quarter, up 12.2% sequentially and down nearly 7.7% on a year-over-year basis.
Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of other device activations. About 6.3% of our retail
postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. This represents a decline of 70 basis points year over year and up from 5.4% in the
prior quarter.

Our upgrades and momentum in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the recall of the Note 7. Additionally, we experienced an iPhone
7 backlog, primarily for upgrades.

Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide 11.

Consumer revenue increased 0.2% and mass markets, which includes small business, declined 0.5%. Fios total revenue grew 4.4% with consumer
Fios revenue rising 4.2%. The growth in Fios was driven by a higher customer base, strong retention programs, and the demand for higher internet
speeds. Approximately 16% of our Fios internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater.

We continue to see strong demand consistent with prior quarters for custom TV. During the third quarter we returned to normal seasonal volumes
ahead of our expectations coming out of the work stoppage.

Fios internet subscriber growth was strong in the third quarter. In broadband, we added 90,000 net Fios customers for the quarter, which were at
pre-work-stoppage levels. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 24,000 in the quarter. Fios internet penetration was 40.4% in the quarter
compared to 40.1%, representing an increase of 30 basis points.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

In Fios video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which was also consistent with pre-work-stoppage levels. Fios video penetration was
34.5% in the quarter compared to 35.4%, representing a decline of 90 basis points driven by increased open for sale markets and softer linear TV
demand. We continue to see an opportunity to further penetrate the Fios markets we serve.

Let's turn to slide 12 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total.

Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.3% in the third quarter, consistent with recent trends. In the third quarter, global
enterprise revenue declined 3.4% and on a constant currency basis the decline was about 2.9%.

In our Wholesale business, revenues decreased 3.9% in the third quarter. Trends in our Global Enterprise and Wholesale businesses remained
consistent with prior periods. However, we expect that in the fourth quarter will see a decline in Wholesale in the range of 7% to 9% due to
nonrecurring items in the prior year.

Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the period last year, up 230 basis points due to Fios growth and cost management.
We believe we will continue to make progress in expanding the Wireline EBITDA margin. As we expected, Wireline capital spending levels increased
in the third quarter as we returned to normal operations after the work stoppage in the second quarter.

Let's move next to slide 13 and cover strategic positioning and investments.

Network leadership is our primary objective in the markets we serve. We are investing in our networks and building capacity for the future and
positioning our business for new industry growth opportunities. Recently we launched LTE advanced in over 460 markets, delivering improved
service to more than 90% of the US population. We are steadily advancing our cloud and software-defined network architecture and moving
forward aggressively with our densification efforts and pre-positioning for 5G technology.

Our One Fiber strategy initiative is on track and we are building our next-generation fiber network in the city of Boston. In July, the FCC approved
our millimeter wave spectrum band lease agreement with XO Communications, clearing the way for testing 5G technology in different environments.

Our 5G technical trials have been successful and we are now planning our commercial pilot program in 2017 where we will test the technology in
different environments with several infrastructure providers to determine ability to scale and operationalize fixed wireless product offerings. Based
on the outcome of our commercial pilot program, Verizon intends to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband solution in the
United States.

In the third quarter, network usage increased 45%. Digital video is the primary driver of traffic on our network. In order to participate in the digital
media value chain, we have assembled assets to grow in the digital media business. We have accumulated a large portfolio of digital rights and
invested in specific assets to distribute, publish, and create digital content.

In order to drive incremental value from digital media traffic, we are scaling and leveraging AOL's ad tech capabilities to monetize digital impressions
on and off our network. We believe we are strategically well-positioned with the right set of assets to grow in this expanding market.

In the third quarter, AOL's net revenue, measured as gross revenue less traffic acquisition costs, amounted to $486 million, which represented an
increase of approximately 10%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by advertising revenue from programmatic platforms. Over the next two
quarters we expect AOL net revenue to follow seasonal trends, but year-over-year growth to be lower due to one-time benefits in the prior year
from the Microsoft deal, especially in the fourth quarter.

We are seeing strong demand from advertisers for AOL's expanding programmatic capabilities and high-quality data analytic tools. We expect that
the pending acquisition of Yahoo will further expand our scale in the digital media space. This would place us in a unique position to serve unmet
customer needs, participate in digital publishing and video, and to monetize the content.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

On the go90 platform, the level of viewer engagement as measured by daily usage has been rising steadily since re-platforming the application
earlier this summer. In the third quarter, the average daily usage in go90 surpassed more than 30 minutes per viewer, with less than 20% of traffic
served on the Verizon Wireless network. While still early in its product cycle, we are very encouraged by the traction with users primarily attracted
by unique content.

For example, in July we introduced an original streaming monthly reality series titled The Runner. Viewers can watch episodes aired three times
daily via the go90 app, go90.com, and aol.com. The innovative game format, with an emphasis on live user participation, contributed to strong
usage and engagement.

During the quarter, we expanded go90 participation in FreeBee Data 360, a sponsored data service which allows customers to stream live sports,
including NFL games, and music without it counting against their Verizon data. We are seeing increased engagement in the application.

In September, with our partner Hearst, we announced the formation of Complex Networks, which brings together Complex and digital video
networks RatedRed.com and Seriously.TV. In the United States, Complex reaches more than half of the male 18 to 24 population and it is one of
the largest properties for this population. The content produced in this partnership will be available on go90, which we expect will further increase
user engagement and traffic growth.

The rapidly evolving Internet of Things market provides us with new business opportunities for our customers globally. We intend to scale telematics,
ThingSpace, smart city, and other IoT solutions globally. Organically, IoT revenues were $217 million, up 24% from the comparable period last year.

Including two months of Telogis activity, IoT revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter. IoT revenues were primarily driven by telematics.
Telogis, which closed in July, expands our telematics capabilities targeted for the enterprise space. In July, we announced a definitive agreement
to acquire Fleetmatics, a global Software-as-a-Service-based telematics provider in the small- and medium-sized business space, for $2.4 billion.
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.

In September, we completed the purchase of Sensity Systems, a leading provider of IoT solutions for smart city. This transaction closed in October.
The acquisition adds a leading comprehensive suite of smart city solutions to our IoT platform. We are now focused on integrating the assets.

Now let's turn to slide 14 for an overall summary.

As we stated coming into the year, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We continued to deliver consistent performance during this
transitional period. We are executing in a competitive environment. For the third quarter, despite a challenging competitive environment in
Wireless, we added over 442,000 postpaid net customers, retained high-value postpaid phone customers, and improved our Wireless service
revenue trends.

In Wireline, Fios performance was ahead of our expectations. In both Wireless and Wireline we have made significant progress on improving our
cost structure. We continue to invest in our networks and platforms to be the network leader in the markets we serve and we are setting up the
business to return to growth in 2017.

We are focused on developing new business models and revenue streams. In our new businesses we are scaling our media assets and Internet of
Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are confident
in our ability to execute, deliver results, and return value to shareholders while transforming the business.

We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations. Full-year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07
impact of work stoppage. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full-year 2015. Consolidated capital spending at the low end of
the $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion range.

We made a full-year total pension contribution of approximately $750 million, which consists of minimum funding of approximately $550 million,
and a discretionary contribution of about $200 million. We expect our full-year 2016 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 36%.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

While we will be providing more guidance in January, we expect that organically consolidated revenue growth in 2017 will be at a level consistent
with GDP growth for that year and adjusted EPS growth will be at normal levels.

With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP, IR

Thank you, Fran. Jay, we are now ready to questions for Fran and Matt.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Phil Cusick, JPMorgan.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

First, Fran, thanks for all your help in the last five years and good luck going forward. Matt, congratulations on the new seat.

How should we think about postpaid phones and accounts going forward? Given what seems like a saturated industry and reinvigorated competition,
are you more in a mode to harvest the existing customers than hunting for more share in accounts?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Phil; appreciate it. Look, as we came into the year we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high-quality base and
that's what you are seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base, both in phones; but as I've said before, smartphones are
going to be a slower growth for the entire industry as it gets more densified.

But just a couple things that happened this quarter that did have an impact on our overall growth. Really it was more from a gross add basis,
because as you saw, we gave you, for the first time, our phone churn which is at a 0.90% for the last six consecutive quarters. So you can see that
we are continuing to maintain that base and protect our base.

But of course, this quarter some things happened that affected our inward bound or gross adds. One was, as we previously talked, when the
competitive world launches new price plans -- and this quarter it was around unlimited and, obviously, we did not respond to that. But as I've said,
there's going to be a two- to three-week period of time where there is an impact to our growth. And we saw that. But, as I've always said, after that
three weeks everything kind of normalizes back out.

So once we got through that we were off to a really good start with the Samsung Note 7 and then, unfortunately, there was a total recall of that
phone which has definitely impacted our growth, because historically Verizon has always been the number one leader in high-end Samsung
phones. So that has certainly impacted us.

Then, of course, we had the Apple launch and, as normal, everyone is in a backlog situation. So that's just a couple things.

The other thing we saw this quarter as well was we are totally focused on smartphones. You saw that our net smartphone growth was 242,000 and
that's really where we're focused in on. As you saw also, we made some moves in prepaid because where we are losing the subscribers is mostly
in the basic phone category and we know that our postpaid pricing is more premium to the marketplace and less attractive to that segment.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

So we did launch some new prepaid pricing and what we did see was we saw a double amount of our postpaid subscribers move over to our
prepaid, more than we've seen in history. And that accounted for a little less than 50% of our prepaid net adds this quarter.

So we did see some shift in our base, but the good news there is that we did not lose the customer. We maintained the customer, at least on the
Verizon Wireless network.

Going forward, as I've always said, we will continue to be very rational in our competitive response. We will respond when we need to. Obviously,
we responded on the equipment side of the equation. But as we continue here, unlimited is still not something that we're going to move to.

But, as you saw also, we launched new pricing this quarter which we believe also addressed two of the major pain points for our customers. One
was overage. We saw over 7 million of our customers move to the new safe mode plans that we constructed, which will protect them from getting
overage charges in the future.

Then, second, we also allow them to now carryover. If they buy an extra gig for the month, if that gig is not totally used we allow them to carry that
into the next quarter for usage for 30 days.

We have seen some really positive responses within our base, but obviously there was some impact on the gross adds in some of the competitive
environment. We will go into the fourth quarter very strong and, as I said, we will continue to strive to grow all aspects of our business.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Thank you, Mike. Fran, want to add my best wishes to you and thanks for everything.

Following on on the top-line and the growth question, could you just help us bridge the path to the GDP-type growth that you referenced again
for 2017 versus the decline of 2.9% normalized for this quarter? Some of it I guess is around the service revenues, but if you could help us with the
building blocks and the timing of delivering that.

And then I think you were hoping to give us an update on the data center transaction, if you have any news there. Thank you.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Sure. Thanks, Simon. I will take the data center; I will pass the other question on top line over to Matt.

On data centers, we are proceeding with the sale of our data centers. We are currently in negotiations and we should have something to formally
announce to everyone here early in the fourth quarter. So more to come on that, but we are progressing with the sale of our data centers. Matt?

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

So that's with one party, is it?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

At this point, yes, we are in negotiations with one individual.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Okay, thank you.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP & CFO, Operations Finance

Good morning, Simon. So your question about 2017 and where that GDP-like top-line growth will come from, let's break it down by the different
parts of the business.

Predominately in Wireless, as we've said, we've been doing this transition. You've seen the year-over-year service revenue trajectory continue to
improve. We are at negative 6.2% in the first quarter; that came down to 5.4% in the second quarter and 5.2% this quarter.

So as we go into 2017, we now have 60% of the base on the non-subsidized pricing. That will continue to expand and that will obviously be a
contributor to the improvement in revenue next year.

And as Fran mentioned earlier, we expect to get back to year-over-year growth by the end of the year in service revenue. We expect to see consistent
trends within the Wireline business, but remember we only have one quarter of Frontier in the 2016 comparison as we get into 2017.

And then, as you saw in our comments, we continue to make good progress in IoT and the video advertising space and we continue to expect
those pieces to continue to contribute to the revenue as we head into 2017. So when you add all those things up, we are confident at this point in
time that we will be on track to deliver the GDP-type top-line growth and look forward to giving you more color commentary on that in our January
call.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Great, thanks for the color.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Great. Fran, again, it's been good working with you for the last five years and good luck in the future.

With the cable companies announcing that they are going to move forward the MVNOs mid next year, is there anything you can tell us about how
Verizon sees the economics of those agreements? Obviously, given your unique knowledge of the terms, what do you think -- what kind of impact
do you expect it to have on the overall competitive environment that we are seeing in wireless? Thanks.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, John. Look, I'm not going to get into the agreement. Obviously, we're under nondisclosure with Comcast on that agreement and the other
cable providers.

But, look, we knew what we entered we bought the licenses back several years ago. This is a wholesale agreement and, as Lowell and I have
repeatedly said, we would to the agreement today again if we had to. It's a good agreement for Verizon Wireless. It's a good wholesale agreement.

I can't speak the economics of what they're going to do. You'll have to ask them that question.

But, look, as I've said before, the wireless pie continues to grow. Everyone wants to get a piece of this pie. The industry itself will continue to grow
around that pie, so it's not like I believe the industry with the carriers will lose share to anyone. I just think there's going to be more opportunity
for growth.

If you look at the future and you think about the LTE densification projects that we have going on and then you look at the whole 5G world for
fixed wireless, that's going to enter into a whole new growth trajectory for the entire industry. Again, we will compete against the competition.
We will compete against new entrants in the marketplace. We will wait to see what is launched. And, as I said before, we will respond where we
need to respond and we will wait to see what happens.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Okay. Thanks, Fran.

Operator

David Barden.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Can you hear me now? I should've dialed in with my mobile phone the first time. Again, thanks, Fran, for everything over the past few years.

I want to ask two questions, if I could. Just first on the -- it sounds like the IoT and AOL ad tech, etc., are going to be part of the kind of revenue
equation on a go-forward basis. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the margin profile of those relative to the margin of the general
business as we look at it today.

Then second, specifically on the Wireline margin side, obviously we have the new union contract and we are expecting that to have some follow-on
benefits into the second half and into next year. Could you talk a little bit about the cadence at which we might see the margin trajectory of the
business start to graduate upwards towards the legacy 23%, if possible? Thanks.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Sure, David. Thanks for the questions. I'm going to answer the first one. I'm going to have Matt answer the Wireline one.

On IoT, look, we see the telematics piece of this to be a really high growth engine for us and, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're looking at a
24%, without Telogis, growth rate year over year. And mainly most of that is all driven via telematics and hum, so we will continue on that.

As far as the margin profile goes, look, these companies are still maturing. They are profitable, but we expect that the margin profile will continue
to grow as we leverage onto these platforms.

The other thing, too, to note that in the IoT world, since it is a platform-based technology, whether you look at IoT or smart cities, these are all very
what I would call minimally capital-intensive type businesses. And that would go for video as well.

When you think about the return on invested capital, you get there much quicker than, say, on a network-based type platform. So we are expecting
that the ROI on this will happen relatively quickly, but the margin will come and we will talk more about that as we grow this business.

Matt, on Wireline?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP & CFO, Operations Finance

Yes, so had a good quarter in Wireline, as you saw. The EBITDA margin improved to 21.2% so you are starting to see some of that improvement we
have been talking about, especially as we got out of the impacts from the work stoppage.

As we said, we expect that the new union contract would generate $500 million of cash savings through the term of the contract spread across
2017, 2018, and 2019, so you should certainly see that come through. We believe that you will continue to see the Wireline margin expand. We
had a good expansion in the past quarter and you should see us continue to make progress on that as we go forward into the fourth quarter and
then into 2017.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Great. Thanks, guys.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup - Analyst

Thanks for taking the questions. Fran, I also want to extend my best wishes as you approach the upcoming retirement.

If I could just follow-on two questions; first, if you could talk a little bit about where you are in the testing of the 5G services and what you are
learning in terms of the capabilities, performance, and the economic model as a potential third pipe into the home.

And then secondly, just going back to the guidance on earnings where you mentioned that you want to get back to normal levels. Given the impact
of installment plans and the purchase of the Verizon Wireless minority, it's been a few years since I think you could call the changes normal. So how
are you defining what normal earnings growth is for Verizon? Thanks.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Michael. I'll take the first; I'm going to put the earnings one to Matt.

For the 5G, obviously we've been mainly centered around the lab testing of 5G. We are now moving out into the commercial trial, which we are
going to span out across several different cities with several different types of testing with different OEMs. To give you an example, one city may
be a very dense city, going into multidivisional areas; another one might be more urban with just looking at single-family homes, so we are going
to test this in very different types of commercial environments.

The big issue that still has to be answered, quite honestly, is the scaling of the technology. For each small cell, how much can each small cell deliver
to how many households and still deliver a consistent 1 gigabit speed or some speed that is comparable to a broadband connection to the home?
So that still has to be answered and we expect to gain more knowledge around that in 2017 with the number of commercial trials that we're going
to launch.

So at this point that's really all there is to talk about from a 5G perspective. Matt, I will turn it over to you.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP & CFO, Operations Finance

Good morning, Mike. In terms of the EPS growth for next year and where that should come out, you start with the top line and we've already talked
about how you get to that GDP-type growth next year and the changes year over year that you should expect to see. Then you layer in on top of
that the continued cost improvements we talked about in Wireless.

Obviously it started last year with the restructuring of the business. We continue to make good efforts in reducing the cost to run the business,
whether that's reducing the number of calls we receive, reducing the transaction times, moving more of the transactions online, etc., etc., and you
should see more of that continue.

Wireline we have the full-year benefit of the new union contract coming through. You've seen some of the headcount changes that we talked
about that will continue to help us expand the margin there.

And then in the other parts of the business, whether it be the IoT or the videos, we continue to add scale there; the margins there should improve.
So when you add those things up you're going to get to an improvement in EPS that we think is in line with what the expectation out on the Street
should be.

Good morning, everyone. Fran, let me add my thanks and congratulations as well and to you, too, Matt.

I wanted to ask about the Yahoo transaction. First, if you could just comment on press reports about the finding of a material adverse condition or
a change and if you have any update to offer there. But then more broadly with respect to Yahoo and AOL, can you talk about how the proposed
rulemaking at the FCC, whereby, as an ISP, you would likely be held to an opt-in standard for addressability? Does that change your expectations
of how you can monetize either the AOL or the Yahoo asset?

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Craig. On Yahoo, look, Lowell and Craig have both commented on this recently, so let me just reiterate what they have said. We are still
evaluating what it means for this transaction.

This was an extremely large breach that has received a lot of attention from a lot of different people, so we have to assume that it will have a material
impact on Yahoo. Lawyers had their first call yesterday with Yahoo to provide us information, but from what I understand that's going to be a long
process. So unless Yahoo comes up with different process, it's going to take some time to evaluate this. Until then, we haven't reached any final
conclusions around this issue.

As far as the privacy goes, look, I think there's a couple things here. Obviously we take privacy and security of our customers extremely seriously.
We live under the regulation of the FCC, which has a very high standard for carriers around privacy. And what we are looking for is that the FTC
and the FCC come out with a common rule that makes it competitive across the entire ecosystem and that the rules are more consistent, so that
everyone can compete equally and there is no winners and losers within the ecosystem.

We look forward to reviewing the final order of privacy from the FCC and, hopefully, the FTC and then we will have to react to that. But, look, we
are operating AOL today under the current environment and we will continue to operate and, as you saw, we continue to grow AOL under that
purview of the privacy regulations. So I think we will just have to wait to see where this all comes out, but we are hoping that it is an equal playing
field across the board.

Thank you.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Thanks for taking my question and once again, Fran, congrats. It's been great working with you. So my question is, if I look at your postpaid ARPA
in the quarter, it was actually reasonably stable versus the prior quarter. I was hoping you could maybe just give us a little more color on what
drove that, particularly the uptake rate and reaction to the new pricing you put in several weeks ago.

And then just as an extension of that, if we extrapolate the trend we saw here it suggests that maybe you would actually stabilize your service
revenues a little sooner than you are talking about. I'm just wondering what you think the opportunity could be there to maybe get to that
stabilization a bit faster. Thanks.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Matt, why don't you take this one?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP & CFO, Operations Finance

I think what this one comes back to, Brett, is -- and Fran talked about it. Within the base the continued growth of our 4G smartphone base, we had
net adds of 357,000 4G smartphones during the quarter. That is obviously contributing.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We saw very strong adoption from our existing base to the new price plans. We saw a number of those customers step up in terms of the buckets
they are purchasing. And so I think you see that we have a very strong relationship with our base and our consumers continue to take full advantage
of the network. We've seen video use or total usage on the Wireless network up about 45% this year and you continue to see that show up in the
ARPA trend.

So, yes, as you think about heading into 2017, we expect to see -- especially as we've got 60% of the base now on the non-subsidized pricing, we
expect to continue to see some strong ARPA trends as we go forward into next year.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Great, and actually just one quick follow-up. You'd mentioned earlier that there were some device supply issues, for example the Note 7 and some
of the iPhone 7 models, recently. Have those cleared up?

And maybe just at a bigger picture, do think that over the course of the holiday season you are likely to continue to suffer those supply issues and
maybe that could contain some of the upgrades in activity levels we would normally expect?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Well, the Note 7 has been recalled totally and won't be relaunched, so obviously that's a permanent change to the lineup. We are bringing in new
phones for the fourth quarter.

As always, Apple is always generally in a backlog situation for the industry. I don't expect that to change, at least not early in the fourth quarter.
But other than that, Matt, have anything else to add?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP & CFO, Operations Finance

No, that sounds pretty much it. We would expect Apple to get caught up as we go through the quarter here and we will see how that plays out.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Thanks for taking the questions.

loss situation or is there something you're doing there, either with respect to mitigating churn or care or retention efforts? If you can comment on
that, that would be great.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

And then just on the delta between those that are on unsubsidized plans, the percentage of those on those plans versus those making Edge
payments, that gap continues to widen out a bit. Is there retention efforts going on there or is there something else we should be thinking about?
Thanks.

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

I will have Matt do the feature phone one. Let me just answer the unsubsidized/subsidized Edge phone.

As you know, we have allowed our base to upgrade and choose whether they take a subsidized or an unsubsidized plan, so that currently is the
policy that we have. And we will have to review that policy as time goes here into the fourth quarter, first quarter of next year.

So there may be some shifts within that going forward, but right now that policy still holds. And that's why you see some of the separation between
the number of people who have moved to the unsubsidized plan versus the number of people who are currently on a device payment plan. We
will update that in the fourth quarter as we go.

Matt, on feature?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc. - SVP & CFO, Operations Finance

Yes, so I think what you are seeing on feature phones is -- and Fran mentioned this in our earlier remarks -- that you are seeing some part of the
move to prepaid has come from the feature phones. Look, we will have some people who have feature phones in postpaid stay as postpaid
customers and we're very happy to -- glad that they will do that, but we also expect to see some of those continue to move into a prepaid environment,
which may be a better place for them to be.

We also continue to see people moving from feature phones to smartphones and when we get that we see increased usage with those customers
as well. So we will continue to monitor that, but we are happy with the trends where they are going at the moment.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies - Analyst

Great. Look forward to working with you, Matt.

Good luck, guys. Can you get a little more color on the CapEx? It, for you and the whole industry, seems to be coming at the lower end of expectations.
I know you focus on SDN and densification a little bit more. Is this a trend that is sustainable?

And related to this, how do you think your network is holding up versus your peers? A lot of your peers are spending a lot less on CapEx, but the
RootMetrics and other services are saying that their quality is catching with your network. Any thoughts?

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Tim. On the CapEx trends, I think this was all related to the strike that we experienced in the second quarter and we're not going to be able
to catch up on that from an overall or year-over-year perspective. So that's why we've revised guidance to the lower end of our range, but we are
still spending around $17.2 billion this year in CapEx.

The other thing, too, is you have to remember we are spending our CapEx around Wireless for LTE densification. And as we have talked many,
many times before, we do our usage projections well in advance of where we believe that usage will come. Obviously, we know that video is the
major driver of the usage with a 45% increase year over year. I think the stat now is over 90% of our data usage is on the LTE network.

We see that continuing to increase, so we are really preparing for two years out from where our usage is today so we are densifying the network.
And we've seen this movie before where CapEx trends go down and user catches up and then all of a sudden the networks falter.

Look, I think the RootMetrics reports speak for themselves. Once again, we won hands down across the country. That is the brand that we live by
and we will continue to build and densify our networks to meet our customers' demand before they actually realize they need it.

Operator

Amir Rozwadowski, Barclays.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thanks very much and once again, Fran, wanted to echo prior comments wishing you the best of luck with your next endeavors and congrats,
Matt, on the new role.

I was wondering if we could talk more broadly, Fran, about your M&A strategy. Clearly, you folks have made a concerted effort towards improving
your asset portfolio to support both the media co and IoT initiatives. As it stands today, do you see any areas where you may need to bolster your
pool of assets in order to move forward with these strategies? Or as you exit this transition year should we consider 2017 more of an integration
year for you folks?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

I think that's right, Amir. I think -- look, we have made some strategic moves here around diversification. We know that the telematics business is
a business that has high potential and, if you looked across the industry, there are a lot of competitors in there, but no one really has a big share
within that marketplace. We want to gain more share within that marketplace and we think we can with the assets that we have accumulated
between Telogis and Fleetmatics here.

So we will continue to move in that direction, but I don't think that there's anything large on the table at this point. We now have to integrate those
assets and that's what our telematics group is actually doing right now.

As you saw, we launched hum. Hum came out of the telematics group; although it is, for the majority, sold through Verizon Wireless, it actually is
a product to come out of the telematics group. So we will continue to innovate in that area.

OCTOBER 20, 2016 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

You are starting to see us do a little -- a few things around smart cities, because we believe that with the pre-positioning of 5G and the latency
issues, smart cities is going to be an area of growth for the future. We have demonstrated with certain cities where we are deploying it now that
we can actually save them money on a lot of different things and that their payback is relatively quick. So I think that is just something that we are
positioning for the future.

Then around media co, obviously we have the Yahoo asset sitting out there, but to date we have accumulated assets that we believe are really
strategic for us to grow this business. And as we've said before, we know that the wallet share of consumer for communications has been flat for
relatively the last 15 to 20 years, so we have to think about a different way to monetize our network capability and that monetization will come
through advertising.

It's real simple. I mean the equation is, if you get more views, you get more advertisers, therefore you generate more revenue. We see that now
with AOL. Even with the 10% increase in revenue year over year, which is the first time we've given that to you, we are starting to see that advertisers
are coming to our platforms.

So now we just have to integrate and execute on that model and we believe we have the right assets to do that. The long and short of the answer
is there is nothing large out there that we need to be successful with at this point in time.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thank you. A quick follow-up, if I may, on the media co strategy. It does seem like increasingly many are attempting to gain share from consumers
via video; not just some of your peers in the market, but on a whole technology company level as well.

How do you view your positioning and your ability to differentiate going forward? I guess the question I have is what have you learned about your
strategy thus far, be it with AOL, Verizon Digital Media Services, or go90? And how is that informing your strategy going forward in your ability to
differentiate?

Fran Shammo - Verizon Communications, Inc. - EVP & CFO

I think the big differentiation here, Amir, is we are developing content for short form and really for live. And that's really the differentiation is short
form content, whether that's over-the-top or via mobile. Also I think the differentiation for us is the integration across our platform. If you go to
AOL now, you're going to start to see Complex come through. You will see RatedRed and Seriously.TV in the future come through on that platform.

If you look at the NFL, we've adopted that into the go90 platform and I know there's been some articles around viewership of NFL. We've actually
seen a healthy increase Year over year on our platform around the NFL, so we are headed in the right direction.

The key learnings here have been you need to have the right content that is appealing to the audience that you are going after. You've seen us
make moves; you're going to see us move out of certain content that was originally in go90 that just isn't the right content. But sports, news, live,
original content is the direction that we are taking on this platform and we think we will be successful with that.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thanks very much for taking the questions.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of about $620 million, primarily associated with early debt redemption costs of $454 million and
acquisition- and integration-related charges of $166 million pertaining to Yahoo and other acquisitions. The net impact of these after tax was
approximately $374 million, or $0.09 per share.

Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.98 in the third quarter compared to $1.01 a year ago. Included in
our EPS is a $0.01 impact due to the natural disasters in Texas and Florida during the quarter.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call. Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by reviewing the progress on our strategic
initiatives before getting into detailed results.

The cornerstone of our strategy is to provide our customers with the best network experience available. We are steadily investing to advance our
4G LTE leadership and actively building the network of the future. Our network performance leadership was evidenced by a sweep of third-party
surveys for the first half of 2017 and the network's resiliency during the recent hurricanes and wildfires.

We delivered solid operational and financial performance in a competitive environment. We grew our retail postpaid and prepaid wireless bases
with new unlimited data options and maintained strong customer retention. Service revenue trajectory also improved as expected.

Our wireline results were consistent with the past quarters, despite ongoing consumer video headwinds throughout the industry. Demand for our
high-quality fiber-based products remains strong. Our Oath team's integration of AOL and Yahoo is ahead of our internal expectations.

We are confident in the execution of our strategy to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows, and produce long-term value for our
shareholders. The Board of Directors demonstrated our commitment to return value to our shareholders when they declared the 11th consecutive
annual dividend increase last month.

We will start by reviewing the third-quarter segment operating performance followed by a progress update on our new businesses, a walk-through
of consolidated results, and finally network and technology updates.

Now onto the wireless segment on slide 5. Our wireless business delivered another strong quarter of operational performance in a highly competitive
environment. We grew and retained high-value postpaid customer relationships profitably.

In August, we expanded our postpaid unlimited data plans to include a lower price access entry point, which provides consumers with more choices
to experience the leading 4G LTE network. With confidence in our network, we are now addressing a larger market with unlimited.

Given our clear and comparable service value proposition, momentum continued in the quarter. Smartphone net adds were 486,000 versus 242,000
last year. Total postpaid net additions of 603,000 included phone net adds of 274,000, 91,000 tablets, and 238,000 other connected devices, led by
wearables. We added 30,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 107,000 last year.

Total retail postpaid churn was 0.97% for the third quarter, which improved by 7 basis points year over year. Postpaid phone churn was 0.75% and
was the main driver of the improvement in total postpaid churn. Postpaid device activations were nearly 9.8 million, of which 82% were phones.
Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.5%. During the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on device payment plans.

Prepaid net adds were 139,000 for the quarter with an increased focus on the smartphone value proposition. Additionally, we've recently expanded
our offering to allow families the flexibility to combine different prepaid plans at a great value.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Let's turn to slide 6 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 2.4% in the third quarter
as compared to a 3.9% decline a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, service revenue declined 5.1% versus a 6.7% decrease in the previous quarter.
Sequentially, service revenue increased for the first time in 12 quarters.

The key drivers of overall improvement in service revenue include increased access revenue through customer migration to higher access points,
new account formation, and the tail end of the transition of customers to unsubsidized pricing. We now have approximately 78% of the postpaid
phone base on unsubsidized plans as compared to 60% a year ago. We expect the service revenue trend to continue to improve in the fourth
quarter and to exit the year with a decline of less than 4% year over year.

In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 5.5% due to a higher device payment plan take rate. The percentage of phone activations on
device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, which is consistent with the prior period. We expect the take rate for device payment plans
for the fourth quarter to increase seasonally due to heightened consumer equipment activity. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers
had an outstanding device payment plan balance at the end of the quarter.

Wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.2%, up slightly sequentially and up from 44.9% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, we
expect the improvement in service revenue to flow through wireless EBITDA margin, partially offsetting pressures from higher seasonal volume,
advertising expenses, and promotional activity.

Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 7. Total reported wireline revenue grew 1.1%, including XO operations and data center divestitures.
On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.7%, which was consistent with the prior quarter.

Our fiber offerings continued to gain share and grow revenue, partially offsetting the decline in legacy copper products. Consumer markets revenue
increased 0.9%, driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue grew 4.6%, including the impact of two marquee pay-per-view events
during the quarter.

Verizon was recognized by a leading third-party study as the top rated residential Internet provider for customer satisfaction in the Fios footprint.
Fios Gigabit Connection, which launched earlier this year, continues to gain traction, offering symmetrical speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second.
We added 66,000 Fios Internet customers in the quarter.

Fios Video results were pressured due to the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings as well as competitive promotional
activity. Fios Video losses were 18,000 in the quarter.

Enterprise solutions revenue, excluding XO, decreased 5.0%, while growth in fiber-based products continues. On a constant currency basis, revenue
was down 5.3%.

Partner solutions revenue declined 3.9% on an organic basis, which is an improvement over prior periods. Within business markets, fiber revenue
is increasing, driven by demand for Fios broadband products.

On an organic basis, total revenue declined 5.8% year over year. On a comparable basis, the third-quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 21.1%
compared to 20.3% a year ago and up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by ongoing cost control measures.

Let's move next to slide 8 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. During the quarter, our Oath team has been executing
on more than 20 integration work streams. We are positioning the business for the future, locking in early synergies and setting out a roadmap for
the next several years with expectations to realize $1 billion in operating expense synergies through 2020.

With the addition of Oath, Verizon's addressable market has expanded from millions of wireless and wireline customers to about 1 billion global
content consumers. We are combining the best aspects of AOL and Yahoo to create a uniform and integrated platform to drive engagement and
consumer value. Oath revenue was $2 billion for the quarter. We will provide additional information on Oath in future quarters as we progress
through the integration phase.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Telematics revenue was over $220 million in the quarter, including Fleetmatics and Telogis. Total IoT revenue on an organic basis increased
approximately 13% in the quarter.

Let's move next to slide 9 to wrap up with our consolidated results for the quarter. The solid segment results in the quarter and addition of new
businesses drove improvements in the consolidated top-line reported results.

In the third quarter, total operating revenues were higher by 2.5% on a reported basis. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions,
consolidated revenue declined 2.3%. Similar to recent quarters, the primary driver was the year-over-year decrease in wireless service revenue.

On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.7%, up slightly from prior year's margin of 36.5%. We are focused
on driving profitability through cost and capital efficiencies across our business. As Lowell announced in September, we have targeted $10 billion
in cumulative cash savings over the next four years.

Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 10. We had a strong quarter of cash generation supporting our consistent capital
allocation program and returning value to shareholders. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $17.2 billion, including working capital pressure
primarily due to the $3.7 billion increase of device payment plan receivables.

Year-to-date capital expenditures were $11.3 billion with a sequential increase for the quarter driven by increased spending in wireless, supporting
growing network demand while pre-positioning for 5G. We expect full-year 2017 capital expenditures to be at the lower end of the guided range
of $16.8 billion to $17.5 billion.

Free cash flow from the first 9 months of the year totaled $5.9 billion, which included a net after-tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1
billion. In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset-backed securitizations, which we initiated in the third quarter of last
year.

We did not execute an asset-backed securitization during the third quarter, but have generated $2.9 billion year to date from our ABS borrowings.
Over the last few days, we completed our third public ABS transaction this year for $1.4 billion.

The impact of device payment plans and on-balance-sheet securitization is expected to approach a steady-state by year end, reducing working
capital headwinds during 2018. We anticipate working capital fluctuations throughout the year due to seasonality in wireless equipment volumes.

We ended the quarter with $117.5 billion of total debt, comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on-balance-sheet
securitizations. Our near-term unsecured maturities are modest at $2.3 billion through 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with the
financial flexibility to grow the business.

Let's move next to slide 11 to discuss our network and technology. Our industry-leading wireless and wireline networks are the cornerstone of our
strategy. And we consistently invest to ensure that we have capacity to serve growing demand, technology to reduce the cost to serve, and a
network position to lead the industry into the future.

We continue to win awards in third-party studies that test a combination of coverage, speed, and reliability. Based on the confidence in our network,
we broadened our unlimited options to offer more customers an unmatched unlimited experience on the best wireless network.

As expected, the introduction of unlimited pricing plans has increased the LTE network usage across various busy-hour timeframes and geographies
as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day. We are more effectively utilizing existing network capabilities
and service plan features to handle the increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience.

Just over 50% of our available low- and mid-band spectrum portfolio is being used for 4G LTE. Network reliability and resiliency are critical elements
of our wireless network. We are thankful and proud of the work performed by our employees during the tragic natural disasters in Texas, Florida,
and Northern California, who ensured that first responders and all of those affected were able to rely on our network in a time of need.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We maintained a high level of performance through our planning, network redundancy, and rapid response, despite widespread power outages.
Although we are not a wireless network operator in Puerto Rico, we have offered assistance to the local carriers and government officials as they
work to recover from unprecedented hurricane damage.

We are steadily investing in the network of the future, which we call the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. This network has many components
that lead to a multiuse, software-driven network at scale.

It goes from the wireless or wireline access networks to an intelligent distributed computing platform to a highly automated software-enabled
core network. This architecture is enabled by a dense flexible radio network with deep multiuse fiber that we have been building for years.

As we see new use cases, this Intelligent Edge Network architecture will meet the new types of application demand. We will leverage these enhanced
network capabilities such as latency, throughput, and security to create network slices that will be tuned to the specific needs of each application.

Our precommercial 5G fixed wireless broadband trials are continuing. Live customer experiences on the network provide key data and learnings
that will give us valuable insight for commercial deployments. We are on track to share trial results later in the fourth quarter.

Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile. Global
development is accelerating based on our work alongside industry partners for multiple use cases.

Let's move next to slide 12 to review our strategy for future growth. We are confident in our strategy to drive future growth while delivering
near-term results. We are laying the foundation for the network of the future while maintaining a strong lead in 4G LTE coverage, capacity, and
reliability.

Our focus is on preserving and growing our customer relationships while expanding our presence in digital media and telematics. The execution
model is to deliver strong fundamental results, allocate capital to our networks, maintain a strong balance sheet, and return value to our shareholders.

Our wireless value proposition has evolved to allow more customers to experience unlimited wireless plans on the best US network. We produce
solid operational and financial performance across the business in a competitive environment while investing in our best-in-class networks and
driving near-term cost efficiencies.

Our long-term strategy is to change people's lives by delivering the promise of the digital world while leading the industry and innovating for
future technological applications. 5G provides a path for growth with fixed and mobility use cases with 4G interoperability. The 5G ecosystem is
progressing with standards and technology development and we are pre-positioning our network with fiber investments, spectrum resources,
and cloud architecture.

With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so that we can get to your questions.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you, Matt. Eunice, we are now ready to take questions.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Great, thank you very much. Good morning. Matt, you mentioned the $10 billion cost reduction program. Could you just give us a little bit more
color around some of the buckets on that and how should that layer through the next four years?

And then on unlimited, any updated stats on what percent of your base or what percent of your new customers are taking that plan? And obviously,
since you changed it to the two or the three plans, who is taking the lower rate plan versus the higher? Is that splitting more towards the higher
ARPU plan? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Simon, and good morning. So on your first question around the $10 billion, Lowell announced that last month. Since then, we have put a
dedicated team against that and we are starting to get around that work. It's a little early to get into some of the specifics of the timing of when
you should see that.

But in terms of the bucket that that's going to come across, really think about all parts of the business are in focus here. Whether that is the network,
whether that be distribution and care, and even obviously the shared service parts of our business and across the complete supply chain, we are
going to take a deep look across the whole business and identify areas where we have the opportunities to significantly improve the efficiency
and how we operate the business.

So we will have -- as we get further into that program, we will share more specifics over time, both on where the savings are going to be realized
from and also the expected timing. But I think we are off to a good start with it.

In terms of your second question around unlimited and the new price plans, I will tell you that between unlimited and the Verizon 2.0 that we
introduced last summer, we now have approximately two-thirds of the base on plans where they can control their overage spend. So that is up,
as you would expect, from where we were a quarter ago. And so obviously a significant part of the base now has the ability to do that.

The mix is as expected between the two plans. We are not going to go into the specifics of each of those. I would tell you, though, that in the third
quarter, we saw, as we expected, the migration of existing customers from data bucket plans to unlimited plans shifted to where on average they
were stepping up in revenue from their bill prior.

And as we expected, we knew initially we would see optimizers who had the opportunity to move to unlimited and save money. We saw that in
the first quarter as we introduced those plans.

In the second quarter, we continue to move through that. By the end of the quarter essentially that was flat as customers migrated over. And then
in the third quarter we got to the point where the customers migrating over were actually increasing. And you saw the increase in ARPA sequentially
from 2Q to 3Q for the first time in three years. So we are seeing good progress there.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Great. Just one quick follow-up. Any impact then on 2018 or is it really going to be ramping through 2018 so that the impact is more 2019/2020
from the $10 billion?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

You will see some impact in 2018, but it's a cumulative number over those four years. But absolutely we will see benefit in 2018.

Operator

John Hodulik, UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Matt, couple questions on the wireless growth and profitability. First on the upgrades, saw a low number in the third quarter. As you guys look out
to the fourth quarter, do you think that changes and maybe bounces back a little bit? Like, maybe you won't see as much seasonality as you typically
do? We're basically trying to get a sense for whether it's a lack of change in the technology or just customers at this point waiting for the 10 to
come out.

Then related to Simon's questions, you saw sequential growth in service revenue for the first time in a while this quarter. It sounds like those trends
are sort of inflecting. Could you guys return to year-over-year growth sooner than the third quarter next year, given those underlying trends you
are seeing in ARPU?

And related to your comment about margins, does that mean that we might not see the typical downdraft in margins we typically do in the fourth
quarter, given the flowthrough effects that you mentioned?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, John. So as you mentioned, the upgrade rate in the third quarter was a little lower than we've seen in past years. I think what you're seeing
there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we've historically seen.

Obviously Apple is part of that. We are splitting the new devices between the 8, which came out in 3Q, and the X, which comes out in 4Q. But also
on the Android OS side of the house, with having the new Google device coming out this month as well, I think you are going to see more of --
we'd expect to see a shift in some of the volumes versus typically from 3Q to 4Q.

So look, as we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand. And look, if you are paying
$1,000 for a new handset, you are going to want that to be on a good network. So we are very confident that we will get more than our fair share
of that activity when it comes through in the fourth quarter. But obviously, we will wait to see exactly how that plays out.

In terms of the sequential revenue trends and as you highlighted, we were up in service revenue from 2Q to 3Q. That was in line with our expectations,
as we discussed on the last call. As you start to see -- a combination of a number of factors.

We have largely migrated the consumer base to unsubsidized pricing. It was 78% in 3Q, 75% in 2Q. So that transition is largely done and so you
are no longer seeing as much of a tail -- sorry, a headwind from the reduction in the line access fee. And as I mentioned, we are starting to see step
up in migrators over.

In addition to that, we increased the number of accounts for the second quarter in a row. So you got the total volume in the business up as the
rate we are getting from customers going up, too.

So as I said in the script, we expect to be inside a 4% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. And as I have said previously, I expect that we
will get to service revenue growth during 2018.

In terms of your questions about margins, it's a little too soon to say where they will play in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as we are now on
unsubsidized, you don't have the same subsidy headwind. But we will see what the environment is like in the fourth quarter competitively and we
will respond as necessary. So we will see where that shakes out between now and the end of the year.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Great. Thanks, Matt.

Operator

Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you can maybe unpack the improvement you've continued to see in postpaid churn, particularly
postpaid phone churn. You obviously have much better visibility into your customer base than we do.

So for example, to what extent do you think that this is a structural improvement in churn as a result of customers moving into unlimited plans
and other plans where they can control their overage? To what extent do you think it might just be that the seasonal pattern of device launches
has been moved a bit and so we could see it move back to prior levels as we go through that cycle?

And then just as an extension of this question, some of your competitors have been looking to lower churn by including free or deeply discounted
streaming video products as part of their bundles. I am curious whether that is something that you think would make sense for Verizon as well?
Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Brett. Look, I would say as I look at the churn number, we have always had a good churn number. Obviously 0.75% continues the trends
that we saw in the second quarter. And really continues the trend since we saw mid-February, when we launched unlimited.

And as we said at the time, the key driver of launching unlimited was to protect our base of customers, which we think is the best, the most valuable
set of customers in the industry.

So look, there's a number of things that go into that. But I will tell you one of the biggest pieces is the network experience that Verizon customers
have. They get to see that they understand the reality of our network experience versus some of the others and we saw that with some of the recent
natural disasters.

So customers on our network understand that when things really matter, Verizon is a network they want to be on. So that continues to be a key
part of it. And look, I believe we can continue to have very good churn without necessarily needing to bundle in other aspects into the core offering.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Is it fair to say that you would expect that on a seasonal basis going forward -- so for example, on this fourth quarter, you still think you might do
better than you did a year ago, even if there is an uptick in devices and maybe industry-wide churn?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

You mean do better year over year with respect to the churn number?

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Yes, yes.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, I think -- look, we've seen that since we launched unlimited and we had a clear and comparable offer in the marketplace. We have demonstrated
that our customers prefer being on Verizon rather than moving somewhere else. I have no reason to believe that will change in the fourth quarter
as we go forward. So very confident that we will see that trend continue.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Thanks for taking the questions.

Operator

David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just a couple. First, Matt, you kind of highlighted the impact of divestitures and acquisitions on the revenue
line, which was about a 5% swing versus the reported numbers. Could you maybe walk that down through EBITDA and then to earnings with
respect to all the different moving parts year over year?

And then second, Lowell was pretty widely reported as talking about working on a content type of program or partnership or acquisition as you
worked into the back part of the year. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what the goal is for that project and maybe how it ties to your plans
for launching your own over-the-top video product? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, so I will start with the second one there. So with respect to Lowell's comment around content and a potential deal for usage rights, I would
say we are continuing to work that particular transaction.

Lowell, when he made that comment, expected that it would be done by now. Unfortunately, it has taken a little longer to dot the I's and cross the
Ts. But fully expect to see something there as we move forward.

In terms of the over-the-top, really nothing new to add versus what Lowell said last month. Look, this is a space where we think there's an opportunity
for us to play. We think that it makes sense for us to play in that space, but we don't want to launch just a me-too type product.

So we are continuing to look at what makes sense for us to launch something that's differentiated in that space. Probably around live programming.
But how and when we launch something will be TBD.

In terms of your questions around the M&A side, obviously at the revenue line, we brought Yahoo in, you brought XO in. And those brought revenue
on day one when you've closed the transaction. So same things with the telematics businesses we closed in the back half of last year.

But initially, especially the telematics businesses and Yahoo, not significant at the EBITDA or EPS line. Maybe a little bit of pressure at the EPS line,
if anything, about $0.04 on a year-to-date basis.

Then they also bring depreciation and amortization, which is why there may not be a huge amount of pressure at the EBITDA line. But as you move
down the income statement to operating income and EPS, we see a little pressure this year. As we expand those businesses going forward, we
expect them to contribute in the future.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Great. Okay, thanks.

Operator

Mike Rollins, Citigroup.

Mike Rollins - Citigroup - Analyst

Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the three- to five-year view for wireless.
And just help us understand -- Verizon's expectations with the investments you are making, the technology that you are deploying, how investors
should think about top-line growth over a more extended period of time.

Then secondly, if you could delve into a little bit more detail on some of the businesses you've acquired now over the last couple years in terms of
both in telematics. And how should investors think about the growth of those businesses over the next couple of years as well, on the top line
especially? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Mike. So as you think about the wireless business going forward, and obviously I'm not going to talk specifically about our views on 2018
and so on. We will have those discussions when we get to January.

But as you think of the business overall, we are very confident with where you are seeing the growth start to migrate to. We have talked about the
trends in service revenue, the fact that we should expect those to get back to positive during 2018 once we've worked through the transition fully
from subsidized to unsubsidized pricing.

We think it will continue from there. We will continue to add net adds to the business based off the quality of the network. And then the network
will be -- continue to expand the capabilities there as we transition to 5G. And we think that will give us other opportunities to expand the wireless
business going forward.

So we are very confident in the future trajectory of the business there. And obviously, as we think about a three- to five-year view, the overall GDP
is going to play into that.

But as I think about 5G and what it is going to do for the business going forward, and then as I think about the new businesses coming in and
contributing as we expand those, and then continuing to work on the cost side of the business as Lowell described last month, I don't think you
are going to recognize the business five years from now versus where it is today.

Mike Rollins - Citigroup - Analyst

If I can just follow up on that point. The wireline business is something where you upgrade a significant amount to fiber, but you also have some
copper. You are competing for a full triple-play bundle in a lot of your markets, but you are smaller relative to some of your video competitors.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Have you thought about doing something different in the wireline business in terms of the way the footprint will look? Whether it's through 5G
or other investments in the wireline business or other strategic options for that asset?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, so there's a lot in that question, Mike. So, look, fundamentally as you think about the wireline business, you are thinking about -- there's really
two assets there. You've got the legacy copper business, which continues to have secular declines across our set of customers, whether that be
consumer, enterprise, small business, whatever.

Then you have the fiber side of that business, where we see continued growth in demand. And that is just not within the ILEC footprint, it's more
on a national scale.

So if you think around, we have had the ultra long-haul backbone for a number of years now. Earlier this year, we expand that with the XO acquisition,
which added fiber metro rings in 45 of the top 50 markets. We obviously have significant fiber in the Northeast Corridor as we have been building
Fios over the last 10 years.

So you should expect to see the fiber side of the wireline business continue to grow and become more relevant. And then as part of that, you've
got the convergence of the networks between the fiber network and the wireless network as we densify in 4G and pre-position for 5G. So as we
go forward here, we think that the combination of those networks is incredibly important.

Operator

Craig Moffett, MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Analyst

First, Mike, I just wanted to say congratulations on a terrific career in IR. And thank you on behalf of all of us for all the help you've given us. And
Brady, congratulations on your new position as well.

I wanted to ask about consolidation, because it's obviously so topical. And from what Sprint and T-Mobile have said, we could see an announcement
as early as next week. Can you talk about how you think a Sprint T-Mobile merger would change the competitive landscape? And would you argue
to the FCC and DOJ in favor of approving a transaction like that?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Craig, look, I'll tell you, there is a lot of various rumors and so on around the industry all the time around various M&A activity. And I'm not going
to comment on other people's businesses.

I will tell you, we have the right set of assets to compete irrespective of the industry structure. And that's what we are focused on and I'm very
confident in our ability to be successful however things play out with other people.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Analyst

Thanks. Could I ask -- since there's not much to say on that topic, one separate question there. Could you update us on the 5G fixed wireless
broadband trials, what you are seeing? And how that informs your expectations for what you are going to do in 2018?

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Absolutely. So we will have more specifics on that later in the quarter and we will get the right folks talking about that. But I can tell you the trials
are going very well. And we are getting a lot of good experience using the millimeterwave spectrum and some of the things we are seeing, whether
it's the fact that we can deliver service without needing line of sight.

Whether, as I think about MDUs and the number of floors we can deliver service to being more than we expected. We've experienced delivering
service in MDUs above 20 floors, which is more than we thought it would be going into the trial.

So a number of good things coming out of the trials. We will get back to all of you later in the quarter with more specific details on the results of
the trials and what that means for 2018. But nothing has changed about our intent to launch a fixed wireless broadband offering during the course
of 2018.

Operator

Mike McCormack, Jefferies.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC - Analyst

Matt, in the prepared remarks, you talk about over-the-top and some of the video pressure that we've all been hearing about a lot more recently.
How do you guys look at that? When you look at the customers leaving you, is it leaving just the video piece of it and maintaining the broadband
connection? Or are you just seeing a shift to different providers generally?

Then secondly, the spread between those making device payments in wireless versus those that are on unsubsidized plans, how many of those in
your best estimate are people that actually were making a payment plan to you guys, paid off the phone, and are opting into sort of a lower price
point instead of upgrading the phone?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Mike. So, look, on your first question, there's really nothing new here to us in terms of the trends we've been seeing over the past few years
around whether it's cord-cutting or cord-nevers or whatever else.

In fact, we've spoken in the past, two or three years ago we really started speaking about this and the fact that we said the traditional linear TV
bundle is not long-term sustainable. And you saw our reaction to that when we launched some of the different plans that we launched at that
point in time.

But so we are not surprised by what we've seen around the TV now. But I will tell you what is important. When you move to over-the-top for your
video entertainment, the quality of that broadband connection becomes more important than ever.

And if you want a quality broadband connection, Fios and a fiber-to-the-home connection is the best option out there. And we continue to see
strong numbers on the broadband side of the business as a result of that. And we are very confident that the Fios Internet offering will continue
to be very strong in the marketplace.

As I think about the spread between the unsubsidized and the subsidized payments, look, what you have here is you do have customers who were
on subsidized pricing get to the end of their two-year contract. And they then move to unsubsidized pricing and not necessarily getting there
through upgrading to a new device and doing that on a device payment plan.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

But that migration, as we say, is largely complete. We now have 78% of the base, which means virtually all of the consumer base is now on
unsubsidized pricing. So as we go forward here, that gap between the this year and the last year number will get narrower and narrower. And that's
what's going to help drive the service revenue trajectory improvement as we go forward here.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC - Analyst

Matt, I'm sorry. Just quickly on the hurricane issue. You guys called out the $0.01 impact. But anything with respect to volumes in wireless that may
have been even better had the hurricanes not hit?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Certainly we had in both Houston and Florida, we had periods of times when our stores were closed and certainly is an impact. But we also saw
good volumes as soon as those stores reopened.

Customers realizing that in times like that, you want to be on the best network. And so we saw an uptick as soon as those stores reopened. And I
have to give credit to our teams, whether it be on the network side and all the things they did. And also our teams on the distribution side of the
business getting those stores open incredibly quickly after those storms. They did a fantastic job.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC - Analyst

Great. And congratulations, Mike and Brady.

Operator

Jennifer Fritzsche, Wells Fargo.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst

Great, thank you for taking the question. Matt, if I may, I just wanted to ask on fiber. Because we've all been brought up to believe fiber is really
expensive to deploy. And yet we see you coming in at the lower end of your CapEx range.

Not asking you for guidance on 2018, but are you seeing some savings with these XO properties? Are you pulling those laterals yet or is that going
to be more of 2018 event?

And then if I also just could ask, the other element of 5G is spectrum. I think Lowell has been on record saying you feel comfortable with spectrum,
might not even sit in the next spectrum auction. Could you talk a little bit of how you -- as you look at your inventory, are you feeling comfortable
still with what you have? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, I will answer the spectrum question first. We are in -- we believe that we have a great portfolio of spectrum. As you look at the 4G network,
only approximately 50%, just over 50% of our spectrum portfolio is serving that network today.

We have got additional spectrum assets that will serve that network in 2018, whether that be re-farming the 850 megahertz and PCS or whether
it be putting the AWS-3 to work. Additionally, as you move into a 5G world, we look forward to closing the Straight Path transaction and the XO
spectrum transaction as we head into 2018.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

So we are comfortable with our spectrum positions. As we think about future auctions, we will wait to see what is in there and make assessments
at that time. But very comfortable with the portfolio we have today.

And obviously as we think about adding capacity to the network, we have more than spectrum as the tools available to us as we go forward. And
we have talked about the different technology and architecture tools with LTE Advanced and all the different pieces in there. We continue to be
able to add capacity as we move to more software-defined networking and those type of tools.

And then obviously, densification. And that densification is based off having more fiber available in the network. So to get to your first question,
we continue to deploy fiber and we will continue to do that as we head into 2018.

As you say, I am not going to talk to 2018 CapEx at this time. But you should expect to see us continue to be deploying fiber around the country
as we go forward to service both wireless but also customers across the rest of our businesses and getting into IoT applications as well.

Operator

Amir Rozwadowski, Barclays.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thanks very much. I was wondering if I could build upon the prior questions around your spending trajectory. If we think about this lower-end
CapEx target for the year, how should we consider the outlook against that backdrop of investment?

Clearly, focusing on network quality is a clear focus for you folks. I'm just trying to unpack the commentary a touch, whether it's a shift in some of
the spending priorities that's taking place that's enabling you to get to the lower end? Are we seeing inflection with the benefits from software-defined
networks flowing through the business at this point? Or anything to that effect, Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Good question. Thank you, Amir. So as I think about the CapEx for the year and where it's coming in towards the lower end of the range, that's still
going to be around $17 billion of spend. So certainly not an insignificant number.

Some of this is just the timing of the activity with the network teams between 2017 and 2018. But look, I'll tell you, the key thing here, and you talk
about has there been a shift in priorities, and I would say absolutely not.

The priority to continue to invest in the network, whether that's adding capacity for the networks today or pre-positioning the network and being
at the leading edge of building the future network technologies, that priority is unchanged.

And as we head into 2018, you will see that we will continue to spend to continue to do exactly those things. So no major change there. We will --
as we head into 2018, more spending on fiber as we pre-position for 5G and continues to make sure we have the leading network.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thanks a lot, and one follow-up, if I may. In touching upon that 5G commentary, in recent weeks, we have seen some notable developments around
the broader ecosystem, in particular the announcement with Qualcomm to accelerate the global 5G standard in millimeterwave spectrum.

It seems like mobile 5G, in terms of its availability, is now being pulled forward. Is that going to affect the type of services that you plan to offer?
Could we see mobile 5G a bit earlier than anticipated here? Any color to that effect would be great.

OCTOBER 19, 2017 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, I think we were very proud to be part of that announcement with Qualcomm earlier this week. And really what you are seeing there is as we
have talked about now for the past two to three years, we said if we put our shoulder behind 5G development, we think we can accelerate versus
some of the timing that was taking place.

And in fact, there were some people who were saying they didn't even think 5G was going to be real and if you're going to be able to use
millimeterwave spectrum. So we've demonstrated that by our efforts so far.

We've brought the ecosystem together. We've pushed forward the timing of standards coming forward. And not surprised by any of that at all. It's
exactly as we expected.

In terms of the timing of mobile 5G, it is certainly not a 2018 activity. But you talk about does it change our view on the types of services we will be
able to offer? Absolutely not. We've seen a wide range of services that we will be able to offer on 5G as being why we've been so excited about it,
quite frankly. And why we put our shoulder behind getting the ecosystem to move faster on this than they otherwise would have been. And we
look forward to being in position to offer those services in the years ahead.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thanks very much for the input.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

We have time for one last question.

Operator

Tim Horan, Oppenheimer.

Tim Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst

Thanks, guys. And just to pound the CapEx again. Matt, are you seeing any benefits from the SDN in terms of pricing of equipment? And can you
just talk about as you move to 5G, should we think about CapEx stepping up a couple billion dollars a year?

There is a lot of articles in the press over the last couple years that it might cost $20 billion, $50 billion to build out a nationwide 5G network. Any
color around that would be great.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, so thanks, Tim. So in terms of benefits from SDN and so on, I mean, sure. As you -- not just SDN, but also network function virtualization, it does
allow the value of some of the hardware you put in the network to change over time. And how you operate the network moves more to the
underlying software there. So I think we are seeing those trends as we continue to expand the network.

In terms of deployment of 5G, I think some of the people who were estimating those numbers are getting ahead of themselves. And it's just too
early to tell. So as we have more visibility into the timing of spend around 5G, we will share that with you. But it's way too early at this point and
I'm not going to comment on those estimates.

Tim Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst

And then just lastly, on the $10 billion of expense reduction, how much of that do you think you will reinvest in maybe growth in the business? I
guess how should we be thinking about the longer-term margin trend over a three to five-year period?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, so as you think about that money, really once we generate those savings, it becomes part of the overall pool. But I'm excited about the
opportunities that the teams are developing to grow the business going forward.

And it's important that we make sure we have the resources in the business to invest in those things. And we can't be investing in those things if
we have inefficiencies in the core business at that point in time.

So we just think it's a responsible thing to do to make sure that we constantly look at the efficiency of the business. And look forward to generating
those savings and discussing that more with you in the future.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Tim, thank you. And before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back to Matt for a few closing comments.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our
high-quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions.

We are well positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry into the next generation of technology with our strong
network assets. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and to generate long-term shareholder value.

Finally, before I close the call today, I want to personally thank Mike for his commitment and the support he has given to me and many others
throughout his career at Verizon. And we wish him all the best in the future.

Also, I'd like to welcome Brady Connor to the IR team. I have known Brady for several years and he will be a great successor to Mike in addition to
the IR team. Thank you for your time today.

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $1.19 per share on a GAAP
basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to walk you through.

Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of $159 million, primarily associated with the early debt redemption costs of $476 million; acquisition-
and integration-related charges of $137 million, primarily pertaining to Oath; and a pension and benefit remeasurement credit of $454 million.
The net impact after tax was approximately $120 million, or $0.03 per share, resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $1.22.

Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings
per share was $1.01 in the third quarter, up 3.1% compared to $0.98 a year ago.

It has been three quarters since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated within
the table on slide 4. As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue, offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue, and
the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments.

The impact from this change has been fairly consistent during all three quarters of 2018 with a $0.06 per-share impact in the third quarter. We
continue to expect the accretive benefit to full-year earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31. The accretive benefit to operating income
in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenues and commission costs converge.
This will create year-over-year EPS pressure in both 2019 and 2020.

For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted, financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability
with prior periods.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt to take you through the results for the quarter.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thank you, Brady, and welcome, everyone, to the first earnings call in the 5G era. Installations of 5Gs Home by Verizon, the world's first ever 5G
commercial product, began earlier this month, continuing our proud history of driving innovation. It is just the first service of many to come on
this new and exciting technology.

In the third quarter, we continued our strong operational and financial performance by executing on the fundamentals with laser focus while
retaining and expanding our high-value customer relationships. Our methodical and disciplined capital allocation model affords us the flexibility
to compete and win in the marketplace while investing in our best-in-class networks, strengthening the balance sheet, and returning value to
shareholders. Also, during the quarter, our Board approved the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend.

Critical to our ongoing profitability is the work we are doing across our business excellence initiatives that are transforming all parts of our Company.
In 2018, this has included adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, driving capital efficiencies from the network restructuring that
began last year, and more recently evolving our IT strategy and the announcement of the voluntary separation program. These initiatives are
focused on positioning us to meet the rapidly evolving demands from our customers for years to come in a competitive environment.

Let's move next to slide 6 to discuss our network and technology. During the quarter, we extended our leadership position, delivering the best
network performance and overall experience to our valued customers. We won more J.D. Power awards than any other wireless provider for a
record 21st time in a row and ranked highest in wireless network performance in all six regions of the US.

In the most recent Nielsen report on streaming data quality, our reliable network ranks highest in video success ratings. And finally, we continue
to extend our RootMetrics leadership position, obtaining the highest percentage of wins nationally.

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

While we are excited to be at the dawn of the 5G era, our 4G LTE network will continue to be a foundation of our services for many years to come.
We continue to make enhancements to our 4G network through fiber and small cell densification as well as the deployment of new technologies
to provide additional functionality and quality.

5G technology will provide meaningful value above the current network experience. At Verizon, we believe that true 5G requires an ultra-wideband
solution utilizing millimeterwave spectrum to address the full array of use cases that 5G enables.

Our network preparation for nationwide 5G deployment requires deep fiber resources, a vast array of small cells, critical spectrum holdings, and
mobile edge computing capabilities, all of which we have been assembling for years.

5G Home by Verizon continues our legacy of consumer firsts. We are now providing wireless broadband service using millimeterwave spectrum.
This revolutionary product offers customers a wireless in-home Internet experience with speeds and capacity that rival leading wide broadband
products available today.

The initial launch of 5G Home on proprietary standards in four markets positions us for a larger rollout in 2019. We are gaining valuable insights
ahead of the industry that will drive refinements to the customer experience prior to the arrival of global standards-based equipment. We have
said all along that we intend to be first, not only in launching the world's initial 5G commercial product, but also the first to deliver true 5G mobility
to consumers.

During the quarter, we completed the world's first end-to-end global standards compliant call with a smartphone test device using our network
facilities in Minneapolis. As soon as devices and equipment are available, the deployment of our 5G network on the global standard will begin for
mobility and residential broadband in the new 5G ultra-wideband era.

Let's turn to slide 7 and take a closer look at consolidated financial highlights of the quarter. On a reported basis, third-quarter consolidated revenue
was $32.6 billion, up 2.8%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, total revenue was $32.5 billion, up 2.6%. The primary
driver of the increase was improved wireless service revenue due to customer step-ups to higher access plans and an increase in the average
connections per account.

On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, third-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3%, which was up from prior year's margin of 36.0%.
Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.4 billion or 3.4%, due primarily to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued improvement in
operational efficiencies across the business.

Our business excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash savings of $1.3 billion year to date from a mix of capital and operational
expenditure activities. The program remains on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative savings for the four-year period.

Let's now focus on cash flow results on slide 8. During the third quarter, we continue to drive strong cash generation. Year-to-date cash flow from
operating activities totaled $26.2 billion, an increase of $9.8 billion from the prior year. This was driven by strong operating results, supplemented
by the benefits from tax reform and the completion of the transition of device payment plan securitization to on-balance sheet financing.

Year-to-date capital spending of $12.0 billion supported the increased demand on our industry-leading 4G network, the launch of 5G Home earlier
this month, significant fiber deployment in markets nationwide, and pre-positioning for additional 5G services.

We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be between $16.6 billion and $17.0 billion. This reflects the benefits from our business
excellence program, which has allowed us to make all of the planned investments while aggressively advancing the 5G ecosystem and transforming
our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network. This architecture will provide both CapEx and OpEx efficiencies compared to the networks
of the past.

The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $14.2 billion year to date. Our balance sheet is strong and
provides us with financial flexibility. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low levels, which gives us confidence to operate through

different financial market environments. We ended the quarter with $112.9 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $103.7 billion of unsecured
debt and $9.2 billion of on-balance sheet securitizations.

We have made good progress this year towards our goal of strengthening the balance sheet. Operational cash flows and the benefits from tax
reform have resulted in a decrease in our total debt of $4.2 billion year to date while allowing us to make discretionary contributions of $1.7 billion
to employee benefit programs. This has driven a change in the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA from 2.6 times to 2.4 times since the beginning
of the year.

Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with wireless on slide 9. Total wireless operating revenue increased 6.1% to $22.9
billion in the third quarter, primarily driven by strong trends in service and equipment revenue.

Wireless service revenue increased by 2.6%, driven primarily by customer step-ups to higher price plans and an increase in average connections
per account. Our mix-and-match unlimited offering provides customization options to suit the individual needs of our customers while providing
a superior network experience. In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 13.7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher-priced handsets
and increased sales of wearables.

Our postpaid customer migration to unsubsidized pricing has stabilized to 83% of our phone base. Comparatively, the same quarter in the prior
year was 78%. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter, consistent with
the prior year.

The combination of service revenue growth and efficiencies gained within the business have led to segment EBITDA growth of $664 million, an
increase of 6.7% year over year. For the quarter, wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.4%.

Let's now turn to slide 10 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. In the third quarter, wireless operational performance sustained
momentum from the previous quarters by expanding our relationships and subscriber experience with postpaid customers.

Total net phone editions were 295,000 compared to 275,000 last year, including postpaid smartphone net addition of 510,000. Postpaid net adds
totaled 515,000, including tablet net losses of 80,000 and other connected device gains of 300,000, led by wearables.

Our postpaid phone churn of 0.80% is a result of our network quality and reliability coupled with the diversification and personalization of our
unlimited offerings. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.04% was up compared to 0.97% in the prior year. We expect postpaid phone churn to increase
seasonally through the fourth quarter due to the holiday season.

Total postpaid device activations, of which approximately 80% were phones, were down 1.4%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.0%, down
from 5.5% in the prior year. In the third quarter, prepaid net additions declined by 96,000 compared to an increase of 139,000 in the prior year.
Within this, we had smartphone net additions of 15,000. The change in the size of our overall prepaid base reflects our ongoing activity to focus
our prepaid offerings on value-added segments.

Now let's move to our wireline segment on slide 11. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.7% in the quarter as growth
in our high-quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by technology shifts and ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies and
competition.

Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.8%, driven by legacy core declines and cord-cutting, partially offset by Fios broadband growth. Consumer
Fios revenue increased by 1.1%, due primarily to our broadband offerings.

Fios broadband Internet experienced growth of 54,000 customers due to demand for high-quality Internet connectivity. Fios video results continue
to be impacted by ongoing shifts away from linear video offerings with losses of 63,000 in the quarter.

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Our enterprise solutions, partner solutions, and business markets revenues declined by 4.0%, 6.3%, and 7.0%, respectively. Enterprise solutions
revenues declined by 3.8% on a constant currency basis.

Results in each of these businesses reflect the pressures on legacy products and price compression, which at this time continue to offset the growth
in fiber-based products. Segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19.9%. We expect price compression on legacy products, secular trends, and
increasing content costs to continue to put pressure on the wireline margins.

Let's now move on to slide 12 to discuss our media and IoT businesses. For third quarter, Oath revenue was $1.8 billion, which was 6.9% below the
same quarter last year. We are seeing revenue pressure from search and desktop usage, which is more than offsetting positive growth in mobile
usage and video products, including our distribution partnership with the NFL.

Because search and desktop products make up the majority of the Oath business and we believe pressure in those sectors is likely to continue, we
do not expect to meet our previous target of $10 billion of revenue by 2020.

The leadership team at Oath is focused on returning to revenue growth by completing the integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo advertising
platforms by year-end, implementing initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets, and building services around our core content
pillars of sports, news, finance, and entertainment. Additionally, we are utilizing Oath's technical capabilities, such as artificial intelligence, augmented
reality, and virtual reality across all of Verizon.

In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue, including Verizon Connect, was up approximately
12% year over year.

Let's now move to slide 13 to summarize our third-quarter results. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding
our high-quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions.

We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance while building momentum for our ultra-wideband 5G network. Our launch of the world's first commercial
5G product signals the beginning of an era that will transform the way people live and work.

Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network, enabling efficiencies throughout the core
infrastructure, and delivering flexibility to meet customer requirements at the edge of the network. We are excited about our current positioning
in the marketplace, our financial strength, and the opportunities ahead of us.

With that, I will turn the call back to Brady so we can get to your questions.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Yes, thanks. And two, if you don't mind. I just want to come back to CapEx and the lower outlook there. It sounds like you are certainly enjoying
some efficiencies as a result of your cost savings program. I'm wondering if there are any timing considerations. So for example, are we in maybe
a little bit of an air pocket as you ramp down the 4G spend, but you haven't quite hit run rate on 5G?

And then on ARPA, you continue to see some strength there. I was hoping you could deconstruct that a little bit. How much of it is strong product
level ARPU trends, particularly in phones as people take unlimited? And to what extent is it being driven as more devices are attached to accounts?
Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Brett, good morning. So on CapEx, you certainly see the benefit of our operational excellence activities we have been doing throughout
the year. This really started a year ago when we reorganized the network organization and we are seeing the benefits of some changes in how we
run that organization, using new capacity utilization models, changes to our inventory management systems, adoption of procurement analytical
tools, and a whole host of other things.

So this is activity that began last year. It is showing up this year. I will tell you we are getting everything done that we wanted to get done in 2018.
We are just doing it more efficiently than we initially originally expected to.

And I don't see -- you used the word air pockets. I don't see an air pocket here. We have been pre-positioning the network for the transition from
4G to 5G for a number of years now.

So we will get into obviously our views on 2019 and beyond when we talk again in January, but we've got everything done this year we expected
to. And the team has done a great job of just doing it more efficiently, so that will open up more opportunities for us as we go forward.

On the ARPA side, as you mentioned, we've certainly seen some good increase this year, and it's been largely coming from step-ups. We have been
seeing an increase in connections per account.

But as we get customers onto unlimited and they see the quality of the experience there and then they step up from one plan to another plan, we
have been seeing some good overall results in ARPA. I will tell you there is still a good amount of runway there as well. So excited with the momentum
that we have in wireless at the moment and I think there is still some way to go with it.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Great. Thanks for taking the questions.

Operator

Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Great. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Matt, you talked about 5G quite a bit. I don't know if there is any early commentary that you can give us on the
launches and what you are seeing so far.

And then as we think about next year, and I think you said you would accelerate that, what is the timeline looking at like in terms of getting the
standards-based gear? And in particular, a path to having a self-install solution for 5G Home? Thanks.

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Simon. So yes, as you say, we're excited that we are now in the 5G era. I will add that we started doing installs earlier this month. And we've
seen performance as we've expected since we started doing those installs. The technology works, our customers are getting the experience they
expected, and we are getting a lot of good learning which will benefit us next year when we roll out the product to that much larger audience.

5G Home will become more significant as we expand coverage and we get on the global standards equipment in 2019. And I would expect that
that would start to have an impact on consolidated revenues as we get into 2020 and beyond.

And you mentioned self-installs. A big part of what we are learning in these four markets is that install process. So when we get to rolling out across
a broader geography on the global standard next year, we will just have a level of learning about the customer experience that will differentiate
us from everyone else.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Okay. So is that sort of mid-2019 that we start to see this gear coming on in scale?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

We are really dependent on the industry to develop it. We will be ready to deploy both on the network side and the customer side when the
equipment is ready, whether that be from the network OEMs or the customer equipment manufacturers. So sometime in 2019 we will push the
industry to get there as quickly as possible and we will see how soon that happens.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Great, thank you.

Operator

David Barden, Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Thanks for taking the questions. Matt, could you kind of elaborate a little on the voluntary separation program: what the goal is, what the timetable
is, and what the margin impact is expected to be? And where we see that across the wireline and wireless organizations?

And then the second question is with respect to delevering, you've had good success there on the back of the cash flow windfall from tax reform
and operations. With looking down the pike, we've got C band spectrum potentially coming to market, millimeterwave spectrum coming to market.

What are the limits and the parameters around the balance sheet that inform what you are willing to do on the spectrum from so that we can kind
of anticipate where the balance sheet looks like in the next 12 months? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, David. So on the voluntary separation program, the way that I would suggest you think about it is it's part of our overall business excellence
initiative, whether that be the adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, some of the other things that we have done.

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Really what we are looking at is while we are certainly glad to see the financial performance we have today and made good progress there, what
Hans and I are focused on is making sure that we are not just successful today, but we can be successful into the future as well. And that we can
take advantage of any opportunities that come along in the marketplace.

So what this really is about is saying do we have the -- if you were setting up our business from scratch today, would you set it up the way it is? And
there are significant process improvements that we have around us.

And so the voluntary separation program is part of continuing to evolve and transform the way we do business, to continue to improve the
efficiencies across the business, and we will be driving those changes over the course of the next 12 months.

In terms of the size of the impact of it, it is too soon to tell. We are in the middle of the period where employees can choose to accept the offer. So
in terms of the size of the initial charge that will come through in fourth quarter or the size of the benefits that we will start to get in 2019, it is too
soon to say. When we have information on that, we will certainly look to share it with everyone.

But this is just part of the continued drive to transform the business to make sure that we are successful in the long run and have the right cost
base to be able to compete, irrespective of how the industry develops.

On the balance sheet, certainly glad to see the progress we've made this year. Strong cash flow, certainly helped by tax reform, but also the operation
of the business driving a lot of that benefit. So you've seen the leverage come down from 2.6 times at the start of the year to 2.4 times now and so
glad to see that progress there.

I'm not going to get into specifics about parameters about what we may or may not do around any type of acquisition, whether that be spectrum
or anything else. The key for us is making sure that we have a balance sheet that gives us the flexible structure to take advantage of whatever
comes up.

So if you kind of think across those two questions you had, we'll make sure we got the cost structure that we can take advantage of opportunities
that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. So
we can be very adaptable no matter how the industry develops going forward and the opportunities that come up.

Hey, Matt. Thanks. First, wireline margins were pretty stable, but you talked about continued pressure. How do you think about that from here? Is
your comment of about 20% from the last call still a good level or should we expect some degradation?

And then second, you called out a $0.27 to $0.31 tailwind from ASC 606 this year and that that will fade to essentially zero in the next two years.
As we think about the underlying growth in revenue and EBITDA driving earnings, do you think we can expect the Company to grow reported
earnings in 2019 and 2020? Thanks.

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Phil. So on wireline, yes, certainly expect to see the margins over the near term to be in that range we discussed on the last call, around
that 20% level. Would be a little above, a little below depending on the quarter.

But certainly with the revenue trajectory in that business, that will provide some pressure on that margin. So we are focused on continuing to
address both the revenue trajectory and the cost side of the wireline business, but that is something we have been doing for a while and we will
keep working on it.

As you talk about the impact of 606, and yes, we still see about $0.27 to $0.31 of GAAP benefit this year. But when you back that out, 3.1% EPS
growth on an adjusted basis year over year, and that is certainly what we are focused on doing.

So as you think about next year, you really have to take this year's number, back out the $0.27 to $0.31, put a growth rate on, and then put around
half-ish or so of this year's benefit in next year. And that will get you in around the right ballpark.

But net-net, we are certainly focused on getting -- showing growth at the EPS level and at the top line. But we just obviously got some noise from
the accounting as we go over the next couple of years and 606 flows its way all the way through our financials, both for the current year and the
prior year we are comparing to.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Thanks, Matt.

Operator

John Hodulik, UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Great, thanks. Two, if I could. You had some commentary in there on the revenue growth or declines at Oath. Any commentary on the losses we
got -- have you in there for about less than $1 billion this year? Does the sort of I guess change in approach to Oath mean that you could find some
cost savings there as well and maybe get that business closer to profitability as we look out to 2019 and 2020?

And then more broadly on the 5G rollout, the FCC passed some small cell siting reform. Does that change the sort of internal targets you have for
the rollout of the small cell and 5G infrastructure and possibly allow you to go a little faster as you look out to 2019 and 2020? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, John. On the 5G rollout, certainly we were glad to see the FCC rules around the small cell adoption. Doesn't necessarily increase the velocity
that we see. Our teams have been engaged with municipalities across the country on getting permits to put up small cells, whether for 4G or 5G.

Certainly like the fact that they are providing a little more guidance for how quickly that should happen, but I don't see it having a material impact
to our buildout plans. We are going as fast as we can. And while the federal level rules are helpful, it is still a very local activity municipality by
municipality. So a lot of good work going on there.

On Oath, from a profitability standpoint, certainly, as we said in the comments, revenue not progressing quite as fast as we'd like. But from an
EBITDA standpoint, the team's made good progress on their synergy targets coming out of the closing on Yahoo over a year ago.

The integration is now largely complete. We think we will have that substantially complete by the end of the year. So the cost side of that business
is being managed well and we just need the revenue side of the business to achieve its potential, too, and then we will be happy with what we are
doing in the Oath business.

Good morning, guys. I guess just if I want to return to the question a couple of questions ago about growth, you've always said in the past that you
can be something like a GDP grower. If I kind of step back from today's results, what are the moving pieces that get this business back to being a
GDP grower at some point?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, so Craig, when you look at the results we posted today, I'm not sure we have to say what it would take to get back to that level. I think you are
seeing growth in the business year to date, both at the top line and the bottom line. And it is driven by largely by what's going on in the wireless
business.

When you have the best network and when we get it paired up with the right consumer offerings, as we have, and our wireless consumers can
take advantage of that network and the way they want to do so, you see the results we have. We see customers step up, and as I said earlier, we
have still got significant runway in terms of the ability for customers to step up.

So like the number of increasing connections we had during the quarter, increase in ARPA as well, and we very focused on continuing that
momentum. There is a high level of stability in the core of our business, so that's driving top-line growth, as we reported this morning. And then
as we also manage the cost side, I think we will continue to have the opportunity to post good results.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Analyst

If I could just follow up, presumably, just given the maturity of the industry with respect to penetration, it's presumably an ARPU or ARPA story as
you get to 5G. What kind of ARPU and ARPA growth do you think that you could eventually get to in this business? Obviously barring any unforeseen
big changes in competitive intensity.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, so we continue to look for new pockets of demand out there. But this maturity comment we've talked about for a long time now, but we
posted smartphone net adds of 510,000 during the quarter.

So we are continuing to add to our base of customers. There is still a significant opportunity to do that. We have the opportunity to get a number
of our customers stepped up from their current price plans. They often come in on a bucketed data device and then over time they step up into
unlimited. And we now have options there for customers to step up to different levels of unlimited plans, too.

So we still have runway here in terms of developing the wireless business in the 4G world. And then before we know it, we will be talking about
transitioning the largest base of wireless customers in the industry over to 5G devices, too. So I am certainly comfortable that our wireless business
will continue to grow as we go forward.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Analyst

Thank you.

Michael Rollins, Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citibank - Analyst

Thanks. You talked a bit about cost-cutting. And in the past, I think the cadence you were looking for was an incremental $1 billion a year. So that
would get you through a cumulative $10 billion over 4 years.

You mentioned you are at $1.3 billion through 9 months. So is there an opportunity to create even more cost savings over time than the $10 billion?
Or is the $1.3 billion progress to date just pulling from the future, pulling forward some of those savings?

And then secondly, if you could just help us think about what the right cadence is over the next couple years in just broad cost-cutting terms.
Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Mike. So as we think about the cost-cutting, certainly glad to see the progress the teams have made this year. And as they have gone in
and started looking at the business in different ways, we are seeing lots of different opportunities show up. And now we are in the phase of really
executing against a number of those.

So certainly glad the progress we have made. Is there the opportunity to get more than $10 billion cumulatively over 4 years? We will wait and see.
I am not good to provide any change to that number at this point in time, but certainly we are being as aggressive as we can and making sure we
are running as efficient a business as we possibly can and that will continue.

In terms of the cadence of those savings over the four-year period, nothing really to update. I think we are still in the first year. And as you can
imagine, as you start a program like this, there is a lot of energy upfront just deciding the things you want to do, identifying the opportunities,
deciding how you are going to go after them.

And so you are not necessarily turning them into savings immediately. So I think we've still got some good opportunity ahead of us from a cadence
standpoint.

Michael Rollins - Citibank - Analyst

Thanks.

Jennifer Fritzsche, Wells Fargo.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst

Great. Thank you for the taking the question. I wanted to ask about the public safety sector. Obviously with AT&T officially having FirstNet, it seems
in their advertising they are going hard after this sector, which some have identified the TAM is as many as 9 million subs.

Can you talk a little bit about your strategy there? Because you have exposure to hold onto these customers. What are you seeing in that? Are you
seeing any early signs of churn or anything like that? Thank you.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

We continue to perform very well in that sector, and it is built on years and years of strong partnerships and we will be continuing to focus on that
sector. Look, when you have large market share in many segments, as we do, it provides opportunities for different people to decide to go attack
them, whether it be in public sector with FirstNet or whether it be some of the things we've seen other competitors do over the past few years.

I think we have been very effective at defending the market share that we have. It is based on building deep relationships with our customers and
built on the reliability and the performance that they see on a consistent basis. So we will continue to do that across all parts of our business,
Jennifer, and it's really about just service execution. And when we do that on a consistent basis, we typically win.

Jeff Kvaal - Nomura Securities Intl (America) - Analyst

Thanks a lot. Two questions, if I may. The first is on CapEx. I think you have been pretty clear with us that we should not be expecting a surge in
spending associated with 5G. I am wondering if that premise or how we should be measuring that surge from. Is that from where we began the
year in 2018 with guidance or from where we are ending the year in 2018 with CapEx?

And then secondly, on churn, obviously great improvement over the past couple years, although that improvement has reversed a little bit. I am
wondering what you can tell us about what is happening with churn and what we can expect from here. Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Jeff. On CapEx, so really as you say, no surge level. We will give guidance for 2019 when we get into the new year. We will be spending on
5G. You may not see a change in intensity, but we are spending on 5G today. We will continue to spend on 5G just as quickly as we can.

But as we have talked about in the past, 5G uses a lot of the assets we already have in place. As we have been densifying the 4G network over the
past three, four years now, we have been doing it with an eye also to pre-position the network for 5G.

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

And we are seeing the benefit of that. As you see us roll out 5G and get the network ready to deploy and not seeing a massive surge in CapEx. And
we have been pretty consistent on that messaging and I think it is starting to show up.

So look, I think you will see CapEx stay within reasonable bounds of what you've seen from us in the past. And we will continue to take advantage
of the efficiencies in the network, whether that is through the Intelligent Edge Network design, which will create efficiencies. Whether it is across
the other things we are doing on the business excellence side I spoke about earlier.

We will continue to look for ways to build the network that we want to build to provide the best customer experiences, but doing it at the lowest
possible capital intensity. So obviously we will talk more about the plans for 2019 in 90 days or so, but feel pretty good about the activity we have
in the network as we complete 2018.

From a churn standpoint, you are right. We have seen good performance over the past couple of years. And as I have mentioned, it's -- when you
get the combination of the best network, which we have obviously had for a long time, and when you get the customer proposition right as well,
you get great results, whether that is on net adds or whether that is on the churn side of the equation. And we have seen that now for over a year
on the churn side.

So look, there is additional players in the marketplace today, obviously, with using the MVNO agreement and some other things. So we may see
just a few points tick up there, but we continue to -- we will continue to have very strong churn performance as we look forward here and expect
to do so.

Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC - Analyst

Hey, Matt, maybe just a quick comment on what appears to be a pretty good uptick in gross adds -- gross phone adds on a year-over-year basis.
Thinking about what the drivers might be there.

Obviously last year, you had introduced the unlimited plan earlier in the year, so it seemed like you had maybe a tougher comp. Just trying to get
a sense for whether we are seeing any prepaid migrations or anything else in the marketplace we should be aware of?

And then on the Fios video side, I guess no real surprise, but yes, downtick in sub losses there. Is that really just a function of lack of connects or
are we seeing an uptick in churn on the Fios video site? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Mike. So on the phone gross adds, and you mentioned the comp in 3Q. And as I'm sure everyone recalls, 3Q last year was when we saw
the first sequential revenue growth in about three years.

So as we came into this quarter, we knew we were lapping a good quarter from a year ago. So to see the performance in wireless this quarter is
certainly something that we are pleased about the way that the organization has performed in the marketplace.

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

When you think about the phone gross adds, as I said, it's really the combination of the great network experience. And when we went on unlimited,
people were concerned what was going to happen with the network experience.

And we talked at the time that the network team had tested, prepped for moving to unlimited. And all we have seen since we have been on
unlimited is our network performance continue to improve. And in fact, as we sit here in the second half of 2018, I think we are continuing to see
us widen the lead and set the standard for the rest of the industry. So that is part of it.

And then you get the right offer out there. So we launched unlimited, and since we launched unlimited, we have added other flavors to it. We see
customers enjoying that experience and expect them to continue to do so.

In terms of the prepaid-to-postpaid migration, the thing I point your attention to is within the third quarter in our prepaid business, we had
smartphone net adds of positive 15,000. So while there certainly is some level of migration from prepaid to postpaid, it's not driving the 510,000
smartphone net adds that we recorded in the quarter.

So we are very happy with the performance that we saw there. And again, comes back to combining the right network experience and the right
customer proposition, and good things happen at that point.

On the Fios video side, I think just what we are seeing here is is you touched on is, it's the secular trend. Whether it be cord-cutting or cord-nevers,
that certainly continues. What I am pleased about on the Fios side of the business is we saw Internet net adds of 54,000. That says there is strong
demand for broadband.

And as we have said before, if you're going to rely on OTT for your video entertainment, you want to make sure you have got a great broadband
experience. And whether that be Fios broadband or now for those customers who can get in-home broadband through 5G, we believe we have
the best in-home experience out there for those customers who want to get their entertainment from an OTT fashion.

So we will continue to see pressure on the TV numbers, but I would expect us to continue to grow the broadband side of our Fios franchise.

Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC - Analyst

I'm sorry, Matt. Do you see an uptick in churn there or is it just less connects coming in on the video side?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Well, it's certainly less connects coming in, and we see more new customers come in as broadband only. We still see a number come in as triple
play. And the churn side I think is part of the equation, too. But I would start off with it's less gross adds coming in upfront and us seeing more
customers -- the mix of new customers as broadband only versus traditional triple play.

Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC - Analyst

Great, thanks, Matt.

OCTOBER 23, 2018 / 12:30PM, VZ - Q3 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Walter Piecyk - BTIG - Analyst

Thanks. Hey, Matt, the upgrade rate, the decline in it, has really helped your cash EBITDA in recent years. Record low; it looks like 5%. Can you give
us a sense on kind of how the fourth quarter has been going so far relative to the XR was launched? And even just looking into 2019, can you
continue to expect a benefit to your cash EBITDA by lower and lower upgrade rates?

And then my second question on the prepaid side, I mean, prepaid is obviously tiny relative to the overall business. Does it make sense to even
maintain a prepaid product? And would you be interested in scaling up that through an acquisition if Sprint T-Mobile were required to make some
divestitures or if TracFone was looking to sell that business? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Walt. So on the prepaid side, while certainly postpaid is the bigger part of our wireless business, we want to give customers the opportunity
to experience the Verizon network however they want to come on board.

So we value our prepaid customers. We certainly look to focus our prepaid business on the parts of that business that add value. And not all part
of the prepaid segment does, so you have seen us change our approach there.

You should expect us to look for ways to provide offerings to customers across the full spectrum of customers, whether that be prepaid, postpaid,
or whatever. And we will continue to evolve the offerings there.

But as you say, prepaid is certainly a small part of our business, but it is an important part of our business. And we will continue to evolve and adapt
the product offering there over time.

I'm not going to speculate on any other -- anyone else's customers or so on. That is not what we are focused on. We are focused on our offerings
and we will continue to do so.

In terms of the upgrade rate decline, and while there has certainly been some benefit there, I would say the bigger benefit to cash flow has come
from just the operational performance of the business. Certainly the lower upgrade rate has helped.

I don't see that changing anytime soon. Certainly as we get into the fourth quarter, we would expect to see seasonal uptick in the upgrade rate.
But whether it will be at the same levels we saw in the last couple of years or whether we will see a slight year-over-year decline, it's too soon in
the season to tell. Obviously, we are not one month into the fourth quarter and the heavy part of the fourth-quarter activity is still ahead of us.

In terms of there are new devices out there, as you know, and they have been performing about as we had expected. And whether that be -- you
mentioned the Apple devices. And also the Google Pixel is a great device, a new device out there, and we are seeing very strong demand for that
as well.

So we will see where the upgrade rate comes out for the quarter as a whole. But I don't see a major change from the trends we've seen over the
past couple of years.

Matt Niknam - Deutsche Bank - Analyst

Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones. One on enterprise, if you can share any color on how competitive intensity and pricing
trends have been going in enterprise of late, whether there has been any change there.

And then just go back to the question on Oath, are there monetization opportunities you would evaluate with Oath, given the relative scale relative
to some of the larger players in that space? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Matt. So on Oath, the team is focused on the right things. As I mentioned, they are driving demand in mobile and video offerings. And as
I said, we have some great assets and talented people in there at this point.

The business growth is not yet consistent with the quality of the assets of the people, but they are working hard and we believe they are going to
get there. And that is what we are focused on, is supporting that team and the efforts they have.

I would also point out the value that it's harder for people to see that came with the Oath business around some of the very strong technical skills,
whether that be in data analytics, artificial intelligence, VR. And really taking those skills and deploying them across the totality of the Verizon
business is providing significant value, too.

On the enterprise side, I would say no major change in the competitive intensity. We are certainly seeing businesses looking to do more and change
the connectivity profiles of their businesses, but we also are seeing pricing pressure in there as well.

So what is going to determine our success there is if we continue to develop the products enterprises are looking for, not just for today, but for
tomorrow. And as we continue to do that, that will be the determinant of our success in that space. The team is very focused on doing that; they
have had a number of good wins this year. And if we keep on that trajectory, I think we have a chance to like where we will end up.

Matt Niknam - Deutsche Bank - Analyst

Thanks, Matt.

Thanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The 5G era is here and we are positioning the Company for long-term growth by taking
advantage of the full array of opportunities it has to offer.

During the quarter, we again delivered solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We remain confident in our
strategy and priorities, led by building the best networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital
allocation model, and creating value for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your time today.

OCTOBER 25, 2019 / 12:00PM, VZ - Q3 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.25 per share on a GAAP basis. These
reported results contain 2 special items: a net pretax gain from dispositions of assets and businesses of $261 million, and a $291 million pretax
pension remeasurement charge. The gain from dispositions includes several transactions during the quarter primarily the sale of our Sunnyvale
Yahoo! campus as we look forward to moving to our new Verizon Media Group facility in San Jose.

The mark-to-market pension charge was related to our management pension plan, which triggered remeasurement earlier in the year as a result
of the Voluntary Separation Program. The charge is primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate assumption during the quarter. The net impact
of these special items was minimal to net income, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.25, which is up to 2.5% compared to $1.22 a year
ago.

Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the second quarter. Consistent with previous quarters, we have illustrated
the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition and ASC 842 for leases. As we pointed
out the past 2 quarters, we have realized a lesser benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the
deferral of commission expense. This reduction in benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted
earnings per share, which will continue until the end of 2020. The impact was $0.03 for the third quarter and $0.09 on a year-to-date basis.

Accounting standard ASC 842 for leases resulted in a gross-up on the balance sheet for all operating leases at the beginning of the year. In addition,
the lease standard affects our earnings per share primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs, which results in a headwind of $0.01 in the
third quarter and $0.04 year-to-date. We expect the fourth quarter impact to be within the previously provided range of $0.01 to $0.02 per share.

As you can see on the earnings waterfall slide, adjusted EPS growth of 2.5% reflects the strong underlying performance of the business, partially
offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense and the adoption of the leasing standard. Matt will take you through the details of the
quarterly performance later in the call.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Brady, and thanks, everyone, for joining the third quarter earnings call. I want to start by saying that I'm very pleased how well the team
executed our strategy and operation this quarter. We made a lot of progress on our overall strategy, so I'm very happy with it.

Let's start with the network. I think the network team has continued to execute extremely well. I'm confident in our ability to keep winning the
third-party awards on the 4G network. We are just continuing to do a really good job there. At the same time, our team is executing on our 5G
strategy, and we're now up to 15 markets where we have deployed our 5G Ultra Wideband. Our commitment with 30 markets by year-end is still
committed, and we will continue to do so the rest of this year.

At the same time, we also launched the 5G Home city based on the NR standard. That proves that mobile is now moving into the standard 5G to
really see that we get the full benefit of the deployment and the development on the 5G standard when it comes to 5G Home. We're also doing a
lot of things in One Fiber, continue to have a very high pace in that. And that One Fiber is so important for our overall Intelligent Edge Network
that we are deploying in the company in order to realize the multi-purpose network to gain all the efficiencies and serve our customers even better
over time. So in short, a lot of progress in the network.

At the same time, our strategy execution in the quarter showed a lot around our business model, the flexibility we have in the business model. Just
recently, we made an announcement with Disney and our agreement with Disney when it comes to Disney+. I think this proves the model that we
have decided to have with a very strong network distribution and a brand that attracts the best brands on the planet to work with us, and we're
extremely excited over that.

At the same time, we continue to deploy also 5G Ultra Wideband in stadiums especially now with NFL, 13 stadiums when the season kicked off
having 5G coverage. This is important for us because it's part of the dense urban areas where you have a lot of viewers at the same time when really
our 5G is coming to excel. Because of the 5G build that we're doing with our assets is -- we're making a real big difference here.

At the same time, we're also working, of course, with the -- our 5G mobile edge compute. And as we stated already in the beginning of the year,
we're going to launch the first 5G mobile edge compute center in the fourth quarter. And that is in progress, and we're going to announce that
later this quarter. So we're excited on that.

At the same time, you see us engaging much more with large enterprises because with the 5G platform and 8 currencies, we are now a lot of
interactions. We announced in this quarter, for example, collaboration with SAP, Corning. All of them are use cases for the 5G mobile edge compute.
So we're excited to have that opportunity we're creating with the 5G mobile edge compute with the largest companies in the market.

When it comes to Verizon Media Group, they also had a quarter with a lot of strategy execution and came out with a lot of new products in the
portfolio: a new mail service. They also had the enhancement on the Yahoo! Sports and Finance, a lot of traction on it. We saw a great take up on
our NFL that we have now with Yahoo! Sports. So all in all, our Verizon Media Group is executing on the strategy we laid out 1 year ago in a really
good way.

And finally, earlier in the quarter, I think we continued to lead the charge in the wireless and Consumer market with our new mix and match, which
is just continuation of how we want to bring our customers to understand how they can move up in the value chain to unlimited. I have to say
Ronan Dunne and his team are doing an excellent job to really to move this market forward.

And as you can see in our operation performance, we had a really good quarter when it comes to wireless additions here, one of the best quarter
-- third quarter we had in several years. So really, this paying off what we are doing in the model and actually moving this forward. So all in all, a
lot of progress on our strategy. Of course, a lot more to be done, but it's clearly now positioning us where we want to be as a company with our
customers and our shareholders.

Finally, this of course came down to our finance. We had a revenue growth almost 1% in the quarter. More importantly, we continue to have a
wireless service growth in the quarter, we continue on the same level almost we have the previous quarters. And all in all, that converted into
continued EPS growth that we had in this quarter as well. And that is, of course, coming with a very strong underlying operational performance
with some headwinds coming from accounting. But to be honest very good work from the team, which is based on our commitment of cost
efficiencies or Voluntary that were done and all of the things we're doing at the same time.

That also concluded in a very strong free cash flow, continued to take control of our balance sheet and seeing that we're putting ourselves and our
Board in a good position going forward. So all in all, the finance performance really sort of resonated with a strategic execution we did in the
quarter.

We had also a lot of execution when it comes to responsible business, and this is important to us because it's part of our strategy. We made
commitment around our education or 5G to schools. We made commitments around our CO2 emissions. All in all, this is part of our strategy, it's
part of our responsible business. Ultimately, it should be good business for all of us, for our customers, for our shareholders and our employees
who should be part of that journey. So we continue on that path, and we think it's very important for all our stakeholders.

All in all, a very good quarter. The team executed well on all the metrics. There's areas that we need to improve. There's areas that we're still working
on. But in general, I would say that I'm happy and satisfied how the Verizon team is showing up this quarter.

By that, I hand it over to Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results.

OCTOBER 25, 2019 / 12:00PM, VZ - Q3 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

On a reported basis, third quarter consolidated revenue was $32.9 billion, up 0.9%. This growth was primarily driven by higher wireless service
revenue, partially offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline revenue, predominantly in our Business
segment. Year-to-date consolidated revenue is up 0.5%, in line with our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage
growth for 2019.

In the third quarter, we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA margin while positioning for future wireless revenue growth by updating our unlimited
offer and executing effective promotions to drive strong wireless volumes. The headwinds that Brady mentioned earlier from the deferral of
commission expense and the lease accounting standard lowered EBITDA by $240 million, which is approximately a 70 basis point impact on EBITDA
margin in the quarter. As reported, third quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6%, down from 37.4% in the prior year. Since we
initiated our business excellence program in 2018, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $4.6 billion and are on track to achieve our goal of
$10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021. Our Voluntary Separation Program has produced approximately $900 million of expense savings
year-to-date, including over $400 million of savings in the third quarter. The last tranche of employees exited the business in late June, so we have
now reached our full run rate of expense savings for the VSP.

As Brady mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.25, up from $1.22 a year ago. This is the third quarter this year with adjusted
EPS growth of 2.5% or higher, highlighting the strength and momentum in the business. The combination of wireless service revenue momentum,
solid margin performance and strong customer volumes keeps us on track to achieve our adjusted EPS guidance of low single-digit percentage
growth for 2019, excluding the impact of the lease accounting standard. Additionally, we still expect our full year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate
to come in at the lower end of the 24% to 26% range.

Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. As a reminder, our Consumer segment includes both wireless
and wireline products and services, targeting retail customers as well as our wireless wholesale operations. In August, we launched new unlimited
price plans, which provide more choice to customers and an easier entry point into unlimited on the nation's best network. As a result, phone gross
additions were up 10% over the prior year. The popularity of the new mix and match plans and overall value proposition drove postpaid phone
net additions of 239,000 for the quarter, more than double the 112,000 last year. Postpaid smartphone net additions were 372,000, up from 285,000
in the prior year. Total postpaid net additions were 193,000, including other connected devices of 130,000, primarily wearables, offset by tablet
losses of 176,000.

Our network leadership, coupled with the personalization of our customer value proposition led to a postpaid phone churn of 0.79%, which was
similar to last year even with additional market participants. Total postpaid device activations were flat from prior year at 7.4 million, including 6.2
million phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.9%, down from 5.1% a year ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade
cycle. In the third quarter, prepaid net losses were 81,000 compared to a loss of 96,000 last year. Our focus on the high-value prepaid market has
resulted in stable prepaid revenue despite declining volumes.

Fios Internet net additions of 30,000 were relatively flat sequentially and down year-over-year. Fios Video results continued to be impacted by the
ongoing shift away from linear video offerings with losses of 67,000. Our customers see value in our high-quality broadband offering paired with
multiple choices for video through linear TV bundles or over-the-top options, such as YouTube TV and the recently announced Disney+.

Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss Consumer financial performance. In the third quarter, total Consumer operating revenues were $22.7 billion,
which is up 1.4%. This was primarily driven by continued strong growth in wireless service revenue and Fios service offerings, offset by declines in
wireless equipment and legacy wireline services. As we look to add value beyond connectivity, other revenue grew 18.7% primarily driven by
recurring services, such as Total Mobile Protection. Consumer wireless service revenue increased by 2.1% over the prior year even as we introduced
new unlimited pricing. We increased wireless service revenue and ARPA by driving customer step-ups to unlimited plans from metered plans and
increasing connections per account. We have continued room for further growth as around 50% of our customer account base is currently on
unlimited plans. In the third quarter, Consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 5.6% as lower upgrade rates more than offset an increase
in phone gross adds. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.7% due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings.

OCTOBER 25, 2019 / 12:00PM, VZ - Q3 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Consumer EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 45.3%, which was down 30 basis points from the prior year. This
includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard. We are
extremely proud of the team's ability to drive significant volume in the quarter while maintaining strong EBITDA margin.

Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Our Business segment includes wireless and wireline products and services provided across 4
customer groups: global enterprise, small and medium business, wholesale and public sector and other. Business wireless volumes remain strong
with a 12% increase in gross adds for the quarter primarily within small and medium business and public sector. Postpaid net adds were 408,000
compared to 364,000 in the prior year. This includes 205,000 phones, 112,000 tablets and 91,000 other connected devices. Our continued strong
customer loyalty across the Business segment led to phone churn of 0.98%, which is relatively flat sequentially and up slightly over the prior year.
Total postpaid churn of 1.22% was up 5 basis points compared to the prior year. Total postpaid device activations were up 5.7% while our retail
postpaid upgrade rate was 4.5% versus 4.8% in the prior year.

Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. Strong wireless service revenue growth and high-quality fiber products
were offset by softness in legacy wireline technologies, causing total operating revenues for the Business segment to be approximately flat for the
quarter. Revenue from our Business wireless products grew 6.9%, including 6.1% wireless service revenue growth. This performance reflects Verizon's
best-in-class network quality, reliability and solutions-based approach with our Business customers. Revenue from our wireline products declined
6.7% in the quarter.

From a customer group perspective, global enterprise revenues declined 2.4%, driven by legacy pricing pressure and technology shifts. Wholesale
revenues declined by 13.7% driven by price compression and volume declines, which we expect to continue in a highly competitive marketplace.
Small and medium business revenue increased 6.2% driven by wireless service and Fios growth, partially offset by ongoing declines in traditional
data and voice services. Public sector and other revenue increased 1.2% as a result of growth in wireless and wireline products and services.

Business segment EBITDA margin was 25.2%, which was down 300 basis points primarily driven by the decline in high-margin wholesale revenue.
This also includes headwinds of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard.

Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the third quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue was $1.8 billion, which was
down 2.0% versus the prior year, continuing the improvement in revenue trends. Gains in native and mobile advertising continue to be offset by
declines in desktop advertising, though the business is building momentum in key areas. We are migrating customers to our recently integrated
native and demand side advertising platforms with double-digit growth year-over-year. For the first time, we are seeing mobile traffic increases
outpace desktop traffic declines in our core owned and operated products, including sports, finance, news, entertainment, home and mail. Although
it's early in the NFL season, customer engagement has doubled over a year ago in terms of minutes watched as more and more fans are using their
mobile devices to watch games on Yahoo! Sports. We are diversifying our monetization streams in Media Group, including additional customer
engagement opportunities on Yahoo! Sports and fantasy platforms and the launch of new integrated content-to-commerce capabilities.

Let's now move to Slide 12, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we have previously committed to provide
transparency through our transition to the new Verizon 2.0 segmentation, Slide 12 contains a reconciliation similar to the one we provided in the
second quarter. These waterfall charts reconcile revenue and EBITDA from our Consumer and Business segments back to wireless and wireline.

The top chart shows Consumer revenue of $22.7 billion in the quarter. After removing Consumer wireline and adding back Business wireless, we
report total wireless revenues of $23.6 billion, with EBITDA margin of 46.8%. The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from Business to
wireline results, starting with Business revenue of $7.9 billion and ultimately arriving at total wireline revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter, with
EBITDA margin of 17.4%. Wireline revenues were down 3.8% from prior year, with margins down from the prior period as a result of the ongoing
pressures in legacy product volumes and price compression. You can find additional detail in our supplemental information included on our
website.

Let's now move to Slide 13 to discuss the wireless results. Looking at overall wireless, which includes both Consumer and Business, total operating
revenues increased 2.6% to $23.6 billion in the third quarter, primarily driven by a 2.7% increase in service revenue. Based on the momentum in
the business, which is carried over into October, we expect total wireless service revenue growth for the fourth quarter to be between 3% and

3.5%. Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 46.8%. This includes headwinds of approximately 90 basis
points primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margin was 47.7%,
similar to prior year despite the significant increase in volumes.

The success of our new mix and match unlimited plans translated into impressive volumes driven by phone gross adds up 10% to 2.7 million, which
marks our highest third quarter phone gross add performance in the last 5 years. Postpaid phone net adds for the quarter were 444,000, which
were up from 295,000 a year ago. Postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter was 615,000, up 21% from 510,000 in the prior year. Total
postpaid net adds was 601,000, consisting of tablet losses of 64,000 and connected device gains of 221,000, mostly driven by wearables. Postpaid
phone churn of 0.82% was up slightly from 0.80% last year while total retail postpaid churn of 1.09% was up 5 basis points year-over-year.

For the quarter, we increased customer net accounts by 25,000 as compared to zero in the third quarter last year. Total postpaid device activations
were up 1.1%. This was driven by an increase in postpaid gross additions of 4.3 million, up 7.7% from the prior year, offset by a decrease in our
retail postpaid upgrade rate to 4.8% from 5.0% a year ago.

To recap the wireless quarter across Consumer and Business, we reset unlimited pricing and absorbed the initial impact from optimizers. We were
competitive on the promotional front, and we drove strong wireless volumes to set us up for future growth. All of this was accomplished while
growing EBITDA on a like-for-like basis and generating one of our strongest free cash flow quarters in several years. We are excited about the trends
in our wireless products while pushing forward to extend our 5G leadership.

Let's now focus on our consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on Slide 14. Year-to-date, cash flow from operating activities total
$26.7 billion, up from $26.2 billion during the prior year. Benefits from year-over-year operational improvements and lower discretionary employee
benefit contributions were partially offset by higher cash tax payments and payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program. Year-to-date
capital spending was $12.3 billion, which was up slightly from the prior year. Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in data and
video traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network, the upgrade to our
Intelligent Edge Network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint. We maintain our full year
2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion.

The net result to cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first 3 quarters of the year of $14.4 billion. We ended the
quarter with $109.6 billion of total gross debt, which is $3.3 billion lower than the prior year. The unsecured debt balance was $100.8 billion, which
is lower year-over-year by $2.9 billion and lower sequentially by $1.3 billion. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the
quarter was 2.1x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x, reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain focused on reducing
our unsecured debt portfolio while continuing to actively manage our near-term maturities, optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our
cost of capital. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be in order: investing in the business, continuing our commitment to the dividend and
managing our balance sheet to achieve our targeted leverage range.

In the third quarter, we demonstrated yet another period of focused execution. We were able to maintain strong EBITDA performance and generate
solid cash flow while driving significant volumes to set ourselves up for future revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. We continue to
be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, and we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet, all while leading the industry
in 5G development.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady so we can get to your questions.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Matt. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions)

Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

If we look at some of your most recent moves with the unlimited price adjustment and now the partnership with Disney to give away Disney+ for
free for a year, it certainly seems like you're assuming a bit more of a growth posture than we've seen from the company recently. And I was hoping
you could maybe just sort of frame to us why you see this opportunity as we're sort of late in the 4G cycle, not quite in the 5G cycle yet. How are
you hoping this is going to position you as you do get ready to ramp more aggressively in 5G? And then of course, anytime we see an operator
become a little more growth-centric, there's always some degree of investment to create that growth. How do we think about the level of spending
you're going to have to incur to make sure you can keep this momentum going?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you very much. I think that when we -- this is part of the overall strategy that we outlined in the beginning of the year. We have a great
network. We have the distribution and, of course, the brand. We -- when it comes to Disney+, we can partner with the best partners, and it's actually
a win-win. I mean actually, they are gaining a lot to be partnering with us as we are gaining a lot as well. And I think this is a differentiation we can
provide to our customers and give them the flexibility and so on. So I think that first of all, not assuming that this is a heavy investment, it's actually
a win-win in all aspects. I think that's very important.

Then when it comes to our move on mix and match early in the quarter, that has been part of a very rigid planning, very disciplined way of viewing
things where we are actually ramping and doing a pathway for our customers to come into unlimited, moving up in unlimited, where ultimately,
when 5G comes, we're going to have ubiquitous 5G coverage, they can move up to that higher level.

So it's all a plan, but we also said all the time, we see opportunities on 4G as well. I mean we know that we outlined a great opportunity on 5G with
4 different business cases. But hey, we can execute on what we have on the assets we have today, and we are very happy that -- with that in this
-- and we use our strength right now to really see that we are using the market opportunities that we see. And I think that the whole team has been
executing very well this quarter, and that's what you see.

And we have also done other type of partnership, and that's part of our network-as-a-service strategy that we outlined in the beginning of the
year. So I think you see that we see a possibility of continued to grow even in the 4G area, and I think that's important.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. And Brett, if I would just add on a couple of points. You mentioned us having a growth posture. We've really been leaning forward for over a
couple of years now. From when we launched unlimited, we've been continuing to update our Consumer offerings, our customer offerings. You
see those resonate. It's built on the backbone of having the best network experience. So this is an ongoing process that you've seen from us over
the past couple of years. And you should expect us to stay on the front foot going forward.

In terms of -- you mentioned investment in growth. If you look at the wireless numbers as a whole, so -- as you say, very strong growth. But when
you adjust out for the accounting, our EBITDA margin was in line with last year. So it's a great performance from the team that we can focus on
growth and continue to report strong margins. So it's well-balanced there as well.

Operator

Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

How effective were the new plans in driving more subs to unlimited? I heard you mention you still have 50% or so. And I appreciate the commentary
on service revenue on 4Q. What does that tell us about unlimited take rates and moving up or down tiers?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

In general as I said, for us, it's a way for seeing that our customer get the best value. They can mix and match. I think that resonates well with the
marketplace that you can do it. I think that, as Matt said, we have been on the forefoot since unlimited come out in new ways of both offering, but
also giving a wide breadth of opportunities for our wireless customers. So I think that's what we're seeing.

And as you heard from Matt, that means we come in with a good momentum in the fourth quarter, and our wireless service revenue is now increasing
our guidance for the fourth quarter. But remember also, it's both Consumer, and we're doing very well on the Business side as well. I think that
Tami and the team are doing great job on wireless. And then if you see the numbers, we continue to do really solid work across the board here.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Yes. And to follow on from that point, if you think about the 444,000 phone net adds we had in the quarter, we had more than 200,000 in each
of the Consumer and Business segments. So that wireless growth is very well balanced across the totality of our customer portfolio, which is very
good to see.

You mentioned the unlimited percentage. Prior couple of quarters, we were saying we're still less than 50%. This quarter, we had approximately
50%. The new plans give people -- a lot have moved up to unlimited, a great opportunity to do so. We're seeing them do that. There's still plenty
of space and more customers to come there, Phil, and as you see the service revenue guide for the quarter. And obviously when you have increase
in net adds, that gives us greater confidence around service revenues as we look into the future.

Operator

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

I guess a couple for Matt on the financials. I think, Matt, we saw a kind of spike in wireless cost of service in the quarter kind of anomaly I think
relative to history that it could have -- wireless margins could have been a lot -- even better. If you could kind of address that spike, it will be helpful.
And then similarly on the flip side on wireline, kind of almost a 2 percentage point sequential step down in wireline margins. I know you mentioned
that we've hit the full run rate from the voluntary departure plan, which I thought would have kind of supported that. So could you kind of walk
us through what happened in the wireline margin side, too?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, David, for the question. So on the wireless cost of service side, I mentioned that the phone net adds split was fairly even between
Consumer and Business. Business had a more than 10% increase in phone gross adds. And as you are aware, our -- a lot of our Business customers
are still on a subsidy model rather than device payment model, so I think you see the impact of that. But as I said earlier, we had great growth in

the quarter in wireless. And overall margins were in line with a year ago. So we are very happy with the balance of that performance between
growth and the margins.

On the wireline side, obviously, we still have work to do there as you look at wireline. Certainly, we see the continued effect of the revenue declines
in legacy products. That's not new. We've had that for a number of quarters, and we expect that's obviously going to continue.

The key for us in wireline is to develop products and services that will offset those legacy products and services. And by bringing the Business
segment together where we're bringing both wireless and wireline products to our Business customers holistically, this puts us in a better position
to really be that partner of choice for our Business customers as we move into a 5G world. So as we develop those product and services, we look
forward to seeing what comes from those segments as we go forward.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

And I can only add on the wireline side there, the whole transformation we're doing with the new segments is, of course, paving the way for actually
thinking about the customer. This customer extremely important for the digital transformation when it comes to private 5G networks, to mobile
edge compute in the future. So the customer relationship is very important there.

And secondly, as Matt said, the investment that we're doing in the network right now with mobile edge compute with fiber and all of that, that's
of course things that are going to offset that over time. It's not immediate because we have a secular decline on the product portfolio. It's known,
and -- but we constantly work with the front end of it, and I think that putting together what we have done is really, really good. I mean I have,
together with Tami and the team, visited, I would say the majority of all the large Fortune 50 companies in this country right now and talking about
our offerings and what we can do for them in the future. I think we had a really good a good start there, but it will take some time.

So I think this is a very, very important asset that we have, that we need to work on it. That's why we're taking out costs to do it all the time. As I
said, it will not be an immediate recovery, and we will -- but I think we have plans for the future to really do this well. And I see so much encouraging
signs just lately on how we work with this, so yes, that's where we are with wireline.

Operator

Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Two questions. First, anything you guys can tell us about the financial impact to the Disney partnership? And then more specifically, what kind of
lift are you guys seeing from an ARPU standpoint as you guys get sort of non-unlimited customers moving up to unlimited?

And then second, could we talk about use of cash as you guys get to your leverage targets? It looks like you're going to get below -- at or below
2x sometime early next year. How do you prioritize your returns of cash to shareholders versus sort of other needs, like spectrum for instance? And
is there a chance that we could see buybacks come back into the cards next year?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. If we start with the Disney+ agreement. I think, first of all, we learned a lot from our exclusive agreement with Apple music. Both how
we do these as a win-win for both the partner and us. And remember, we are I would say fairly picky who we do this type of partnership. We do
with the best brand, with great products. The same go for Disney+.

Remember, we are offering a lot to these companies as well. I mean we offer a base, solid distribution that no one else has in this country, definitely
the best customer base at the same time, the best network. So I think it's a much more win-win than you might believe as I hear your questions
coming out. I think that we are offering something fantastic for them. At the same time, as you well pointed out, we have a chance right now to
move our customers in our value chain of unlimited again given that we are adding these types of things.

So I think we have a good metrics. We have a good experience from Apple music that we now take to the streaming, and we're going to have a
win-win. It's going to be great for Disney. It's going to be good for us. So I think that's what we have.

On the capital allocation, I mean as Matt said, first of all, we invest on our business. Our CapEx, whatever tuck-ins we need, that's really #1 priority
right now. Secondly, we're putting our Board in a good position to continue to increase the dividend, 13 years in a row of dividend increase. We
want to have them in that.

And then, of course, we continue to do our commitment, which was to get back to pre-Vodafone ratings and pre-Vodafone measurements. So
we're doing that. That's what we execute all the day. And yes, we're getting very close, and we will give a lot of opportunities for the Board in the
next step to think about what they want to do. And that's what Matt and I are doing and the whole treasury team, which I think is doing an excellent
job. So that's where we are with the capital allocation.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. If I will just add a couple of things to that, Hans. And I would say while we're not going to provide any more details about specifically where
we'll be next year, you should not expect us to want to aim to go outside the bottom end of that range, below the 1.75, and you should not expect
us to build significant cash balance on the balance sheet.

Operator

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Hans, I wanted to talk on 5G a little bit. You rolled out the new standards-based 5G Home in Chicago. Can you just give us a little bit of color about
what difference that makes and how aggressively you're going to lean into this in terms of new markets and households until you get the next
generation with the new chipsets? And then related to that, you've got a number of 5G Ultra Wideband devices in your handset mix. Obviously,
you're waiting for the iPhone. But how do you see that -- those devices penetrating your subscriber base over the last few months? And what does
the pipeline look for new devices with that capability over the next few months?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you very much. When it comes to the 5G Home that we launched now with the NR standard, that was an important thing for us because as
you remember, we launched in 4 cities with our proprietary software. Now we have it on the global standard software. So that's an important event
for us.

And the second important event though of this launch is, that we are now having the cell set-up. Remember, we had a North Star, how we want
to do this so differently. So yes, you are right, we are launching this, and it's a lot of new experience that we're giving to our consumers but also
that we are now taking as we have been working since the early launch on the first 4 cities.

As you rightfully point out and I said several times as well, that there's coming a next-generation chipset in the second half of 2020. That's really
when we think we're going to have a more massive deployment of it. And until then, we are deploying in the millimeter wave with the ultra

wideband in so many cities. So when we get that more -- the next-generation CPE, then based on the next-generation chipset, we're going to be
in a very good position second half to actually come out much wider. So this is just the next step for us to get all the insights, billing, experience
for our consumers, so we can really take a big step when it come to the next-generation chipset.

When it comes to the smartphones, as you rightfully said, we have launched all the iconic 5G phones so far this year. We see an exciting take up
on that because many of our customers are taking the phones. And even if you have not launched all cities, they are preparing. So we are paving
the way for them because many of these phones are also extremely good 4G phones, and as soon as we come with 5G for that city, they will also
have that. So that we see on us Brian Higgins that is leading our device organization has said basically all phones coming out next year will be 5G
capable. So we will have a range of phones coming out next year. There's one brand that we don't know, and we haven't talked about them, and
again, they need to talk about when they will have a 5G phone. But all others will basically have their phones coming out.

So I feel good about it, the performance has gone up dramatically. I mean if I look at the Galaxy coming out, the Samsung Galaxy, which is one of
the first phones where in the beginning, we tune up to 500, 600 megabits per second, which we thought was great. That's doing 2 gig right now
constantly in the ultra wideband. So we see also a clear improvement on the software tuning between the network and the handsets. And as we
deploy more and more, we're just getting better and better and giving a better and better experience for our customers.

Operator

Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD and U.S. Telecoms Analyst

How do you see the pricing model evolving with 5G in terms of the opportunity to charge by rate of speed instead of by the current model, which
are unlimited per gigabytes or a certain quantum of gigabytes?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Of course, as we get into 5G, you get a fair amount of new potential ways of charging. I still think that our model for unlimited is really
both helping us and our consumers to go to actually move up in the value chain from getting into the, let's say, the lower tier of unlimited coming
up to the sort of the highest. It's a wide range and, of course, the highest is including 5G. Today, we're waiving that, but all time we see that if you're
going to get that ubiquitous sort of coverage and capacity, and -- that will give us an opportunity.

At the same time, we started adding our flexibility in our business model, having Apple Music, having Disney+ and all of that in the same time. So
I think that we have a lot of tools in our portfolio to continue to drive this forward. And I think that as I always say, I have a lot of confidence in the
Consumer team. And as they have come together today, you see clearly new potentials. I mean remember we have 5G Home coming, we have 5G
Mobility at the same time. There's a lot of things that can be done for us to continue to this journey. And I think that one of the proof points of the
whole new structure is, of course, also that Disney+ is not only for mobility, it's for our Fios customers, and it's for our 5G Home customers. And
suddenly, we think about Consumer as a full segment, which I think it was the whole idea with the new structure we have.

Operator

The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.

Tim Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Hans, can you give us maybe some more thoughts what you think people are going to do with gigabit speeds instead of megabits? When we rolled
out 4G, we had a lot of new innovative kind of applications. Just any thoughts on that as you're talking to the Fortune 500 companies. And are

there ways for you maybe to participate in some of the revenue from some of these new applications with lower -- also maybe lower latency? Just
any more thoughts what you're seeing on use cases.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think that is an excellent question. I mean the first, which is a totally new business model, is 5G Home. That's a totally new way how we use
the technology, which we have never been able to do before because a stand-alone fixed wireless access can never be sustainable financially. In
this case, it is.

Then of course when you think about the 8 currencies coming out from 5G, I think that our conversation with the large enterprises today is a lot
about the latency and the mobile edge compute. Because suddenly, you can transform your factory with robotics by having a low latency. You
don't need a wired factory, so the future digital factory will have 5G. We see also much bigger 5G private networks, where you get security much
higher because it's going to be your network. You define your network, you have a compute and storage for your enterprise. This is a new way of
charging and actually interacting with our customer. And sometimes, there's going to be a software in between that come from a software company,
so we need to work with them as well.

So -- and as I said earlier, I mean this quarter, we're going to launch our first 5G mobile edge compute center. So we are on the path of doing this,
which actually will add more opportunity. Then on the Consumer side, which usually question starts with, which are now end with because I see
so many other opportunities, is of course AR/VR. We see now quite a lot of money coming into the venture side when it comes to 5G innovation.
And I think that as we move into 2020, we're going to see much more. We have our 5G challenge, which we announced at CES where we had a lot
of companies participate what they're going to do with 5G. It ranged from everything what they can do with 5G.

I think we're at the moment of 4G, but way bigger. When 4G came, I didn't know what type of application and new service companies would show
up. I think this is far bigger that we're standing in front of right now, and we have much more insights to it as well.

Operator

The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

Two questions, if I may. Number one, can you talk about the revenue impact of the step-up in the insurance fee on a full year basis and the amount
you expect to reinvest in things like promos and marketing and things like Disney+, so we can get a better sense of the net benefit to the company?
And then secondly, given the slower deployment for small cells, not fiber, but for small cells that's being seen really across the industry, are you
considering shifting more of your investment dollars back to the macro network as we shift into 2020?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can start with the second question. I'm not sure where you say is slow. The definition what is a small cell is, number one, I mean I'm not sure there
is a good definition on that. Of course we deploy a lot of urban cells right now. In my book, that's actually small cell, so I don't think you're referring
to us when you talk about less deployment because we are in the midst of our 5G deployment right now, which is very focused on the dense urban
places where there's no macros, it's small cells. But it depends on what you define as a small cell. They're everything from micro to medium-sized
hybrids to the macros. And -- but in our case, it's not that we're slowing down anything here.

OCTOBER 25, 2019 / 12:00PM, VZ - Q3 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. So Colby, on the question on the revenue impact of the step-up in our insurance products, Total Mobile Protection, from a geography standpoint,
that's in the other revenue line, so that the contribution from that step-up is not in the service revenue line. But as you say, it's -- you saw a good
increase in that line in the quarter. We continue to add value to our customers. It's an example of how we think about the Consumer offering
holistically, whether that be the core service and having it on the best network; whether it be bringing value like we have this year, first with Apple
Music and now with Disney+; and how we bring other services, such as Total Mobile Protection, cloud storage, et cetera, et cetera. So we continue
to look for those opportunities to add value for our customers. And as we do that, you see the impact on revenue, and you see the impact on
volume. So coming out of the third quarter, very strong volumes, great momentum coming out of the quarter, and we've seen that continued
strong momentum here in October as we start the fourth quarter and head into the holiday season.

So all of those things that we're doing around the customer proposition are really driving a lot of positive trajectory for the business right now. We
have good line of sight for that continuing as we go forward.

Operator

The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Crédit Suisse.

Douglas Mitchelson - Credit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD

So for Disney+, you're the national partner for Disney, and the impact for both of you is highly dependent upon getting Verizon customers to sign
up and use Disney+. What would you consider a good conversion rate for unlimited customers to Disney+ customers? And should we benchmark
it to Apple Music usage? And any sort of go-to-market strategy commentary around that would be interesting. But also, you're proving that you
could partner with great content, and I do -- I'm interested in your comments on the benefit of owning media and then particularly the Verizon
Media Group.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you very much. No, I think that it's a little bit different, of course, Apple Music from Disney+ given that the Disney+ is, of course, a heavy
streaming and Apple Music is a fairly light audio. So of course, it also -- when you think about the conversion rate, you need also to understand
you need to be on unlimited when you come up to this one and moving up in unlimited. So of course, it might be a little bit lower conversion rate.
But I still think that our team knows this very well right now. We do the co-marketing. It's great for our customers. It creates loyalty, but not only
that, we give something more for our customers. So I think that we have a good -- we're not giving away the conversion rates right now, and I think
that will put more pressure on Disney than us. So I think that that's a -- but I think we have a good grip on it.

When it comes to our view on content, I think that first of all, when it comes to streamed content or linear content and then all of that, I think that
we are -- we like the model we have. We have a lot of flexibility. We partner with the best. We offer our asset so you're going to see us doing that
in the right places. But anyhow, Verizon Media Group fits very well into our because what we see they are doing is of course over-the-top sort of
Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Sports, Yahoo Entertainment, Yahoo! News, all of that is over-the-top services. Where we get engagement, we learn how
content is working. And of course, then we have our advertising platform then that is getting then owned and operated content that drives the
flywheel of our advertising platform. So it all sinks in.

And then you -- we also need to have that a lot of the content that we now are trialing out for 5G is coming from our Verizon Media Group because
one of the first 5G labs we have actually inside Verizon Media Group for them to be innovating on the next-generation content, with animation,
and holograms and whatever you can think about. So we have good synergy between Verizon Media Group and our network business, which is
extremely crucial for our success going forward.

Operator

Your last question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners.

Michael McCormack - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Telecommunications Senior Analyst

Hans, maybe just a quick comment on the wireless side. Obviously, very strong phone adds in the quarter. Just from a competitive landscape, are
you seeing a share-taking opportunity here with, I guess, potentially Sprint and T-Mobile -- I don't want to call it distracted, but obviously quite
busy. And how that situation might change as you go through 2020?

Then secondly, I guess for Hans also, on the wireline side, are there any opportunities to carve out some of those assets? I know we've been talking
about this for years. But anything that you can see out there that might make sense? And then maybe just one last one for Matt on the legacy
pricing pressure within wireline. What exactly are seeing? Maybe just elaborate on what you're seeing as far as pricing pressures go.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So when it comes to the wireless, and the -- first of all, we think the third quarter was very similar in -- the competitive landscape in the third quarter
was very similar to the second quarter. I mean there were some iconic launches there. So first of all, it is a competitive market. We need to remember
that. It's just that we are having -- we are on the forefoot right now, as Matt said. We have a good chance to continue to monetize on that, then I
think we have a good, compelling network and customer offerings. So I think that's what is important for us.

Of course, as I've said before, the landscape will change in the future here when it comes to competition. Our strategy will not change. How we are
executing right now will be the same. We'll continue to go hard on the network, seeing that the customer-centric organization that we have is
really making the right decision for our customer, creating the products they want. So I think that that's what we're going to do, and we're going
to have the flexibility to see market opportunities that we saw in the third quarter. We move on them, and we are preparing our structure, our
products and our organization for doing that.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, Mike. On the wireline side, the legacy pricing pressures that you questioned about. I mean obviously, we're seeing the pressure, both from
volume and a pricing standpoint. It's not really dissimilar to what we've seen in the past few quarters, but that's going to continue as customers
continue to transition to fiber-based services. That's why we have been doing -- rolling out more fiber, as you know in our One Fiber initiative that's
going to give us more opportunities to sell into those customers as they move off of legacy products. And our fiber build has continued to gain
momentum, increased a little bit in third quarter of over 1,500 route miles a month on average in the quarter. So we're getting to a good momentum
there, and that will open up additional opportunities for us as we go forward to replace those legacy volumes.

Michael McCormack - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Telecommunications Senior Analyst

Hey, Matt, any comment just on the wireline assets? Anything out there that might be interesting?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

No. I think we've done a good job over the years. And when you look at the assets we have now, they fit within the portfolio. Obviously, if anything
comes up, we continue to look but nothing major that we see immediately in front of us there.

Hey, look that's all the time we have for questions today. Before we end the call, I want to hand it back over to Hans for a few closing comments.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So a quick summary. I mean as I said in the beginning, I mean, I'm satisfied how the team have executed on our strategy in this quarter. We continue 
to execute well on our network, 4G and 5G, and One Fiber, as Matt talked about. Our customer-centric model is starting to pay off big time with 
the concerted offerings in the market, both for Verizon Business Group, Verizon Media Group and Verizon Consumer Group. You continue to see 
us hammering on the leadership in 5G, very important for us. A lot of headway or a lot of progress in this quarter especially, and now 15 markets 
up, 13 NFL stadiums, a couple of arenas that host both hockey and basketball as well. So -- and 5G Home coming out. So continued progress there. 
We have more to do in the fourth quarter, which is exciting. And then, of course, we continue with the discipline in the financial environment that 
we're all in and executing very carefully but also taking opportunities when we see them in the marketplace. So all in all, I'm pleased with the 
quarter, and we are happy with the momentum that we're creating going into the fourth quarter. So thank you very much for being on the call 
today.

Additionally, please remember to join us on November 11 for our fall sell-side meeting from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. We will be
streaming this event live via BlueJeans for everyone that can attend virtually. You can find details on our Investor Relations website.

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.05 per share on a GAAP basis.
Reported results include a net pretax charge of approximately $1.1 billion related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities.
Excluding the effect of this special item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.25 in the third quarter compared to $1.25 a year ago.

Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our third quarter earnings profile. Consistent with the approach we have shown for several
quarters, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition in 2018.
We expect 2020 to be the final year that the adoption of this standard will have a material year-over-year impact on our income statement.

We realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 during the third quarter compared to the prior year primarily due to the deferral of
commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported and adjusted earnings per share,
which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.02 for the quarter and $0.07 year-to-date.

For full year 2020, we continue to expect the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09. Matt will go through
the COVID impacts that we experienced across the business in more detail. Overall, we estimate that there was a $0.05 headwind included in the
reported and adjusted EPS from COVID during the quarter. While adjusted EPS was flat in the third quarter, including the impact of COVID and ASC
606, we continue to see underlying growth in our operations.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and thanks for everyone joining this third quarter earnings release from Verizon. I would like to start to reflect over the current
situation we have. Of course, I mentioned several times before, we are in multiple crises: the pandemic is continuing, the economical downturn
and the racial injustice. We, as a corporation, have continued with our 3-pronged governance to see that we're managing this in the best way.

Of course, our team is very focused on the crisis of the pandemic and having a team working on that. But the majority of my executive team are
working with business as usual to see that we continue to move this company forward. And finally, we're also working a lot with new opportunities
that arise from these crises to see that we are actually coming out of a stronger company and actually serving our customers in an even better way.

I would like to say a couple of things on where we are in all this when it comes to our responsible business practices. Starting with the COVID-19,
we have all the time put our focus on our employees' safety and health. That has been so important for us. In this third quarter, we have seen our
retail stores coming back to full operations, of course, with new procedures and processes. We have also seen our engineers being back in full force
in the field to make installations. And you're going to see that later on as we had a really great quarter when it comes to Fios installations.

On the racial injustice and what we're doing here, I would just want to highlight one important thing. This quarter, we published our 2020 Diversity
Representation Report. We disclosed on different levels and different units where we stand on one of our core values, which is diversity and inclusion.

I want to highlight the work that our treasury department did in the third quarter. They issued the second $1 billion green bond, which was led by
minority-owned underwriters, continue our work with the climate change and seeing that we do our contribution. And finally, we also decided in
the quarter to provide our employees with paid time off for employees to vote in these times, which are unprecedented.

Moving on to where we are, and I talked a lot about this as we came into this quarter and the second half of 2020, that this was the year of execution.
And I cannot say anything else that our team has been executing just fantastically. And if we talk about our Network-as-a-Service strategy and our
network, starting with the 4G network, what can we say? I mean the team continues to take all awards. I mean the RootMetrics, we're winning the
best overall mobile network. And on J.D. Power, we're awarded for the 25th consecutive time the best network quality. So the team is continued
to augment and improve our 4G network.

At the same time, we entered in the CBRS auction, as you know, and we gained some 34 megahertz covering 140 million of the population. And
all in all, that is going to help us to augment the capacity in the network, especially on 4G.

Another area which we're very proud of, that the team has done in the quarter is, of course, continue the relentless execution on our 5G network.
And we launched the 5G nationwide last week. And as I said through the whole year, that we're going to launch the network when it commercially
makes sense. And it made sense last week when the iPhone 12 was launched in the market. So now we have nationwide covering more than 200
million of the population of the United States, more than 1,800 cities when it comes to our 5G nationwide based on the DSS technology.

We also continue our expansion on the Ultra Wideband, and we took a leapfrog with 19 more cities, and we are now 55 cities for mobility. We have
43 stadiums and 7 airports. Just continue to augment our Ultra Wideband Network, which is just giving a huge, new experience when it comes to
capabilities, when it comes to speed, latency and, of course, throughput.

We also, in this quarter, launched some home cities when it comes to 5G Home or we added -- so we have now 8 5G Home cities when it comes
to fixed wireless access. And finally, one of the core assets for our Network-as-a-Service is, of course, our fiber and the fiber richness of our network
is a core element in the Verizon, the Intelligent Edge Network. We're on plan for that. In these times, it's just great work, what the team has done
all the way from the 4G network to the 5G network and OneFiber. They're executing tremendously on our commitments for the full year.

All that [Network-as-a-Strategy] (corrected by the company after the call) is based on us being able to monetize on top of that network. And a
couple of very important events this quarter and a little bit after is, of course, setting us up for that monetization. Starting with the 5G adoption
and the ecosystem that we're creating. We're, of course, extremely pleased with the launch of the 5G iPhone, the iPhone 12 that came out in 4
different models, all with Ultra Wideband. That is, of course, setting a precedent how important Ultra Wideband is for an unprecedented or
unparalleled experience on 5G, bringing out all the currencies or capabilities that were talked about before.

Also this quarter, we added now the high-power CPE for 5G Home, which we have been talking on for quite a while. So now we're on the right
track for that as well, continue to be able to monetize on 5G fixed wire access, which is one of the different services, we believe, is going to be
important on 5G.

And finally, the 5G mobile edge compute, which is the third business case we have on the same infrastructure. We have now 5 mobile edge compute
centers together with Amazon. We also announced that Microsoft is now joining us on the mobile edge compute as well, focused on the private
side of the 5G mobile edge compute. So we are actually gathering in some of the most important partners in the ecosystem to see that we can
actually monetize this investment work done in the Network-as-a-Service.

We also have in the network continued with our Mix & Match. And as we earlier reported, Ronan and his team has done Mix & Match 3.0. Very
important in times when there are so many choices, we give our customers the choices to pick their offerings and their way of dealing and getting
services from Verizon.

Finally on that area, our collaboration within the company is very strong. And as you saw during the iPhone launch, we launched with NFL the
super app or the super stadium app, which was created by our Verizon Media Group, which is basically 7 concurrent video streams at the same
time that you can enjoy either in the stadium, which you cannot be today, or at home if you have 5G Ultra Wideband. Once again, we are part of
a much wider ecosystem and to delivering new services.

We're strengthening the core as well with a couple of new things. First of all, we are now going into the LTE Home Internet. We are covering 189
markets in 48 states. This is one way for us to continue to use our great network to offering new types of services.

In the quarter, we also announced our ambition to acquire TracFone. That is adding new opportunities for us in the value segment to support that
segment of customers.

Finally, on the business-to-business applications, which is the growth on top of the 5G mobile edge compute, we now have 5 mobile edge compute
centers. As I said, we are committed to do 10 by year-end, and we both have now Amazon and Microsoft as partners to build that.

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Finally, we have seen great opportunities based on our investment in universal communication services, where we have added our BlueJeans
acquisition, especially in health and education. And as you're going to hear from Matt later on, we have great growth in our public sector very
much based on that. I'm really proud of my team, that they can deliver this strong financial performance in the third quarter in these unprecedented
times as well as with the strong execution of our platforms and our strategy.

On the consumer side, we added some 142,000 new postpaid phone net adds and continue with a very high loyalty for our customer with a very
low churn levels. As I alluded to earlier, we are also very proud of what we achieved in the Fios. In the total Fios, we added 144,000 new Internet
net addition. That's a 5-year high, which is just great work of our Fios with the Mix & Match as well as their offering and the quality we have on Fios.
Of course, there were some pent-up demand. But all in all, it also showed the support from our customers for our Fios offering.

On the business side, we continue to do well on the wireless side, both on the wireless gross adds and net adds. We have still in the business side
the secular decline in wireline. We had good profitability in the quarter even though we continued to invest, and we are not done with the investment
we talked about in the fourth quarter last year that is so important for us to see that we are really supporting our customers when it comes to new
digitalization and new offerings. But all in all, good work by our business group.

Finally, the media group had a sequential improvement. They were down 7% in growth in the quarter. They had very good improvements during
the quarter when it comes to the growth trajectory.

Finally, they continue to add a lot of new opportunities, especially around the owned and operated, where we have good growth in the monthly
active users. If that is in news or in finance, we clearly see that our content is really aspiring and doing well with our customers in those areas. And
finally, our ad tech, especially the demand platform, is adding quite a lot of new customers in these times, which also shows proof of all the
transformation that we have done in the media group.

So looking at the financials. We had a growth in our service revenue, wireless service revenue in the third quarter with 0.3%. We clearly have been
very focused on that one, and it exceeded a little bit also what we said when we concluded the second quarter.

We also had an improvement and growth on our adjusted EBITDA margin with 100 basis points. And that includes, of course, the COVID impact.
So we clearly see that even though we have a decline due to hardware, we are managing our P&L in a good way in all our units.

The cash flow continues to be strong. We have continued to add cash flow in the quarter even though we have the dividend and some outlays for
some acquisitions of spectrum.

Finally, we are doing a positive update on the EPS guidance that Matt will talk about later on. So we feel good about going into the fourth quarter
with a very solid third quarter when it comes to financial and execution and how we're dealing with the different crises that is happening around
us here in the U.S. and the rest of the world.

So I will then hand it over to Matt to go into more details on the financials.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. As we've now completed the second full quarter in a global pandemic, I'm encouraged by the
strength and resilience of the Verizon team, our business and our customers. Our employees continue to deliver on our commitment to our
customers and our communities in the face of uncertain and evolving conditions.

This quarter highlights another example of our ability to execute and drive results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.25, including an estimated
net impact due to COVID of approximately $0.05. In the third quarter, consolidated operating revenues were $31.5 billion, down 4.1%. Revenue
declines were primarily driven by significantly lower wireless equipment revenue, which was down approximately 20% due to lower customer
activity and the timing of certain device launches.

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

We are pleased that total wireless service revenue outperformed our expectations by returning to year-over-year growth in the third quarter driven
by improvements in usage and fee revenues and step-ups to premium tiers of unlimited. In addition, Verizon Media Group's revenue trajectory
improved significantly during the quarter driven by advertising, which returned to year-over-year growth in the third quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $11.9 billion, down slightly from $12.0 billion in the prior year, driven entirely by headwinds from the
deferral of commission expense. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 37.6% versus 36.6% in third quarter 2019, including headwinds
of approximately 40 basis points from the commission expense deferral.

Our Business Excellence program continues to drive significant benefits as a key component of Verizon's resilience and agility. We have realized
$8.3 billion of cumulative cash savings to date and remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion by the end of 2021. Even after we achieve our
target, operational efficiencies will be an ongoing focus across the business to identify additional long-term transformation initiatives and deliver
the related cost savings.

Let's now turn to our segment results, starting with consumer group on Slide 9. Our consumer team continued reopening our retail stores throughout
the quarter, while maintaining vigilance for the safety of both our employees and customers. We began the third quarter with nearly 2/3 of our
retail stores open, although with limited hours, and gradually reopened across our entire footprint with normal operating hours by Labor Day.

Consumer foot traffic is not yet at pre-COVID levels as we have implemented social distancing practices such as touchless retail, appointment
scheduling and curbside pickup. We remain committed to providing our customers with the experience they expect while focusing on their safety.

For the quarter, we added 17,000 postpaid customer accounts compared to a loss of 26,000 in the prior year. We are pleased with the early traction
we've seen from our new Mix & Match plans as the best-in-class value offering, which now includes an expanded bundle from Disney in the top
tiers of our unlimited plans. Our enhanced unlimited lineup is driving elevated step-ups, and we now have approximately 60% of our customer
accounts on unlimited plans with over 1/4 of those on premium tiers.

Customer retention remains very high and is a function of reduced customer activity levels across the industry as well as a testament to the Verizon
network performance and ever-improving customer experience. Postpaid phone churn of 0.63% was an improvement of 16 basis points from a
year ago. We continue to see strong customer collections based on the demand for our services and the quality of our customer base.

Our Stay Connected payment plan that allows Keep Americans Connected customers to pay off their service balance over 6 months has been well
received. Including consumer and business customers, we have approximately 1.2 million accounts on these payment plans, with over 90% having
made a payment and the majority with current balances.

Based on our early activity, we expect involuntary churn in the fourth quarter to be modestly higher than typical levels but to remain better for the
full year compared to 2019. We will continue to work with these customers to keep them connected during these tough economic times.

While postpaid phone gross adds were down approximately 22% primarily due to lower store traffic and changes in timing of phone launches, our
low churn drove postpaid phone net adds of 142,000 for the quarter as compared to 239,000 in the prior year. The retail postpaid upgrade rate
remained low at 4.2% and contributed to the decline in wireless equipment revenue.

In addition to the strength in postpaid wireless, prepaid net adds of 77,000 marks our best performance in several years. We look forward to the
completion of the TracFone transaction to further enhance our position in the segment where we have been historically underrepresented.

In consumer Fios, Internet net additions of 139,000 were up significantly both sequentially and year-over-year. Total Fios Internet net adds across
the company were 144,000, which is our highest total since the fourth quarter of 2014. The demand confirms our customers' appreciation for our
new Mix & Match offerings and the quality of our product when reliable Internet service is more important than ever.

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Our Fios team did an excellent job working through the installation backlog from 2Q, and we are nearing normal pipeline levels after limiting
operations in 2Q for precautionary safety purposes. Consumer Fios video net losses of 61,000 improved slightly as live sports content has picked
up, but cord cutting remains the key driver of video disconnections.

Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues were down 4.3% primarily driven by a
significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to reduced customer activity. This decrease was offset partly by growth of 3.1% in other
revenue, and wireless service revenue was stronger than expected.

Wireless service revenue improved sequentially and was down 0.7% year-over-year compared to negative 2.7% in the second quarter as customer
activity started to recover. The pace of step-ups to premium tiers or unlimited has increased during the quarter and drove underlying growth in
service revenue through higher recurring access charges.

Usage and fee revenue improved sequentially throughout the quarter, but international TravelPass remains at low levels. Altogether, usage, fees
and TravelPass revenues accounted for approximately 180 basis points of year-over-year pressure in the quarter. Consumer EBITDA margin was
47.4%, which was up approximately 210 basis points from the prior year despite approximately 60 basis points of headwinds from the deferral of
commission expense.

Now let's move to Slide 11 to review the business group results. Our business segment continues to be resilient as our customers appreciate the
quality of our best-in-class network and product offerings. Demand in the public sector remains especially strong as our team has done an excellent
job providing critical solutions to customers across state and local government agencies and education providers.

Despite ongoing wireless volume pressure in small and medium business and enterprise, postpaid churn remained in line with 2019. And we have
seen a steady increase in customer activity since the second quarter.

Total business postpaid phone gross adds were down approximately 8% from the prior year. Postpaid phone net adds of 141,000 was down from
206,000 in prior year, but was almost double sequentially as our customer activity continues to return toward pre-COVID levels.

Business segment postpaid phone churn of 0.96% in the quarter improved slightly from prior year driven by favorable retention trends in public
sector and small and medium business. The spend activity continues to be favorable as the majority of our suspended accounts have shifted to
active status. Our business segment customer base has remained resilient, but macroeconomic conditions will continue to play a factor in the
fourth quarter and into 2021.

Let's now move to Slide 12 to review the business financial performance. Total operating revenues for the business segment were down 1.7% from
the prior year. Wireless revenue was down slightly due to declines in equipment revenue, partially offset by service revenue growth of 4.9% as
compared to 3.1% in second quarter. This was primarily driven by public sector and small and medium business and included approximately 280
basis points of headwinds, predominantly from lower roaming and usage revenues in the quarter.

Operating revenues were also impacted by ongoing legacy wireline declines. However, demand for advanced communication services continues
to drive underlying opportunities for the segment. Business EBITDA margin in the quarter was flat year-over-year at 25.2%.

Now let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Trends resulting from the pandemic continued to impact both search and advertising.
However, we are pleased with the sequential improvement from the second quarter.

Total revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, down approximately 7% compared to last year, better than our expected range and up 21% sequentially.
Year-over-year trends continued the improvement that began late in the second quarter as September revenues were down only 2.4% compared
to 19% down in June.

We continue to drive increased customer engagement on our owned and operated properties, with strength in both finance and news as monthly
active users grew 22% and 13%, respectively. For the quarter, we saw ongoing strength in our demand side platform, adding more than 1/3 client

accounts compared to the prior year. Verizon Media expanded our partnerships and increased our commitment to build advertising inventory in
new and emerging formats and launched live events with Watch Together and Yahoo Sports PlayAR. All of these platforms will benefit from 5G
and our robust partnership with the NFL to innovate live events together.

Let's now move to Slide 14 for a quick look at the overall wireless performance. Slide 14 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined
wireless products and services from the consumer and business segments for the third quarter. Total wireless service revenue was up 0.3% from
the prior year, including the headwinds mentioned in both the consumer and business segments, a significant improvement from the 1.7% decline
in the second quarter. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules
on our website.

Now let's review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on Slide 15. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $32.5 billion,
an increase of $5.7 billion from the prior year. The growth was driven by continued performance and strength of the business, a nonrecurring tax
item in the second quarter, improvement in working capital primarily due to low volumes and payments related to the Voluntary Separation Plan
in 2019 that did not repeat this year. As a reminder, we paid 3 of the 4 quarterly federal tax payments in the third quarter, including 2 payments
that were deferred from the second quarter.

Year-to-date capital spending was $14.2 billion, up $1.8 billion from the prior year. Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in
traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband and nationwide networks, the upgrade
to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside of our ILEC footprint.

The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is year-to-date free cash flow of $18.3 billion, a $3.9 billion year-over-year increase.
Additionally, we invested $1.9 billion for CBRS spectrum to further enhance our network strategy.

We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and opportunistically diversify our debt portfolio to optimize our cost of borrowing, ending the
quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.5 billion, down year-over-year by $1.3 billion. Our cash position remains strong, finishing the quarter with
$9.0 billion.

In September, we completed our second green bond issuance with proceeds of $1 billion, primarily in support of our goals to source 50% of our
electricity consumption from renewable energy by 2025 and be carbon neutral in our operations by 2035. The issuance also supported diversity
and inclusion in the underwriting syndicate, strengthening our long-standing partnership with minority-owned financial firms on capital markets
transactions.

Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x. We remain focused
on achieving this target over time while maintaining a strong financial position to give us flexibility to invest in the business.

Let's move on to Slide 16 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. Hans and I are very pleased with the performance of our team
in the third quarter, building on the momentum we've seen over the past several quarters. In the face of an uncertain operating environment, we
are seeing steady improvement across our business.

Wireless service revenue in consumer and business is recovering faster than we initially anticipated. And we expect total wireless service revenue
to grow by at least 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.

We previously guided to full year adjusted EPS of negative 2% to positive 2% change from 2019. Given the 3 quarters of resilient earnings and the
trends we see into the fourth quarter, we expect 2020 adjusted EPS to be accretive and are revising our guidance upward to 0% to 2% growth for
the full year. This includes the previously discussed accounting headwinds, the impacts from COVID and new device launches in the fourth quarter.

We are extremely proud of the Verizon team that puts us on track to deliver earnings growth in a year with truly unprecedented challenges. There
is no change to our guidance for other income statement items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted
effective tax rate.

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

We expect our full year CapEx to be at the upper end of our $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion guidance. The supply for network equipment is strong,
and we continue to deploy fiber and small cells at a tremendous pace in order to enhance our network leadership position and achieve our goals
for 2020.

Our performance this year through 3 quarters has shown the strength of a great team, a resilient business and a sound strategy. Our focus on our
core competencies and the strength of our balance sheet has given us the ability to invest in the business and support all of our stakeholders in
times of uncertainty.

With that, I'll turn it over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of the year.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. Let me just quickly summarize where we are. I think we are in a moment where we are executing against our strategy in a really
good way, and we are creating the opportunities for our growth that we're aspiring for.

And let me start with the 5G. There are so many things we have done in the last 3 months and into this quarter that is really paving the way for our
best network and for our customers to enjoy this tremendous opportunity to be on 5G.

When it comes to strengthening our core, new partners are important for our ecosystem, but we're also looking into new segments. You heard me
talking about the 5G mobile edge compute that we continue with, but also ambition to acquiring TracFone to see that our Network-as-a-Service
is really the fundamental strategy that we can monetize on top of and seeing that we continue to be the leader in this market.

Finally, new revenue models, many of them have been discussed. But clearly, we see a new opportunity, especially in the business group with 5G
mobile edge compute, also based on what's happening with health care and education. And we are taking care of some of them already but more
opportunities coming with partners that we have announced this quarter, but also with partners in the future.

So all in all, a very good quarter. I think we're in a very strong position to continue in the fourth quarter and into 2021 as we're executing on our
strategy.

With that, I hand it back to Brady for the Q&A.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Okay. Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take the questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

I'm sure you're not surprised, but the principal topic of conversation with investors over the past week has been the iPhone 12 promo that you
rolled out and that your peers have rolled out. And if we look at the way yours is structured, it's effectively a subsidy.

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

And so the question we've been getting is, what got you comfortable with the nature of that subsidy design? What positive impact are you expecting
to see on your operating performance as a result of the promo? When are we going to see it as investors and analysts? And is there anything about
the initial acceptance of the promo that has given you a sense that it's working or that you need to adjust?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. I mean let me start by saying that we feel really good about our position and, first of all, with the network we have, the offering that we
are doing based on the Mix & Match, but also the offering you're alluding to and then, of course, the position we have when it comes to the iPhone
12, where we have Ultra Wideband in all of them. So I think we're operating -- we're in a position of strength. We feel really good about our offerings.

We also feel good about the response. I mean it's very early. I cannot say so much about the preorders. Remember, it's only 2 phones that is in
preorder right now. There's coming 2 other iPhones the 6th of November when it comes to preorders. But we're happy with the preorders so far.

And as you've seen from Matt talking about the guidance, we feel also good about the quarter and how we're going to handle this. And as you
know, I mean, this is not the first time we're into a cycle of iPhones. And our guys, they know how to deal with this, and they are very financially
prudent seeing that long term and medium term, this is going to be very positive for our customers and our shareholders. So we feel really good
about it. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans. And Brett, thanks for the question. So as I look at the promos we have around the iPhone right now, the overall construct isn't
very different from what we've had previously. Some of the details are obviously changed from promo to promo, but this construct is very similar
to what we've done for the past few years, really since we've been in an unlimited world.

So we're certainly expecting to see good customer take rates. We expect that to drive step-ups as we get more customers in unlimited and expect
that we are very focused on driving value-accretive growth across the customer base and developing long-term relationships with our customers.
And the promos we put in place right now are very consistent with that methodology that we've had for many years now.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

And just one quick follow-up question. I don't know if you've made a decision on this yet or not. But for how long do you expect this payment offer
to be in the market?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Hey, we'll have to wait and see how the market develops here over the fourth quarter. I'll tell you what, though, I'm very excited.

When you think about having the best network, both 4G and building the best 5G network, you add it with the best device portfolio, you add that
in with the best value proposition with what you've done with -- what we've done with Mix & Match 3.0, that is an incredible combination. And so
there's a number of levers available to us, but I'll tell you what, Brett, I am very happy sitting here today, holding the cards in my hand that we have
and look forward to how the marketplace will develop in the fourth quarter.

The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

First, a follow-up on Brett's. Can you give us some idea of what has to happen to hit the high end or low end of the fourth quarter earnings guide?
Think a lot of people are pretty impressed with the high end, and I imagine that, that would have to be a lot less competition than we're seeing in
the market today, but I appreciate your thoughts.

And second, on customer payment trends, you're the first major service provider to report. Can you give us more details on the Keep America
Connected recovery trends in consumer and business payments? Are those on time? And you forecast that churn should pick up in the fourth
quarter. Can you help us quantify that at all?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Phil. So starting with the first question on the fourth quarter range. So when you look at that, really thinking about the momentum
coming out of the third quarter and the momentum that built in the third quarter with customer volumes improving as we reopen the stores,
service revenue back to growth, step-ups driving that, the move to 3.0, I'd tell you within the service revenue growth of 0.3%, it improved throughout
the quarter.

The number was better in August than in July, and it was better in September than it was in August. So good momentum coming into the fourth
quarter, the best Fios growth number that we've had in almost 6 years, so a lot of positives across the company as we come into 4Q. And then as
you come into the quarter, not just the iPhone launch, but 5G nationwide, a lot of exciting things going on.

So when you look at the year-to-date EPS number, we're up $0.01 on a year-to-date basis. And so we feel very confident with the momentum we
have coming into the quarter that we will ultimately have accretive EPS for the year as a whole, even with the impacts of COVID in there and the
accounting headwinds you heard from Brady and everything else. So it gives us a really good place to finish the year and jump off into 2021.

On the customer payment trend side, again, very pleased with what we've seen from customers on the Stay Connected program that we put Keep
American Connected customers into at the beginning of 3Q. The payments have been in line with what we expected. We have a very experienced
collections process. We have the best quality base of customers in the industry, and you see that come through in the churn results.

As we get into the fourth quarter, you'll start to see the small percentage of those customers that are still struggling with the payments get all the
way through the collections process and a very modest uptick in involuntary churn. But I still expect involuntary churn to be below last year on a
full year basis, which speaks to the testament of the work our team does and the quality of the customers that we have.

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

Could we talk a little bit about from the millimeter wave network perspective, the kind of 2 aspects to the business, one being the mobile network
connectivity. You've talked about deploying about 5x more small cells in 2020 as you deployed in 2019. But I think that people don't have a sense
as to kind of a footprint or a number that you can put around that.

And thinking into 2021 as the iPhone 5G becomes a thing, can you quantify and elaborate a little bit about what the goals are for that mobile Ultra
Wideband Network? And then second, as you've kind of gotten out to 8 cities with the 5G Home, can you kind of put a number around what is that
addressable market look like today? And what is the goal for that to look like in 2021?

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you very much. Let me start. And first of all, I mean, our strategy has been consistent over the years and -- when it comes to the Ultra
Wideband. And the deployment has also been very consistent. And remember, when it comes to the Ultra Wideband, it's just an unparalleled
experience. I mean, you might have seen that yesterday, we actually made test that will come up to 5 gig right now. So this is just giving some
totally different experience.

And that was the whole idea when we started it. We wanted to build something enormously transformative. And that's what we have. And that,
of course, is playing into the whole rollout of the iPhone 12 as well that is all capable of Ultra Wideband.

When it comes to our rollout, I mean, last week, we added 19 cities, and the majority of the cities who had already launched were almost double
the size of the footprint. So we are in an enormously big rollout on Ultra Wideband. And as we said, 5x more base station this year compared to
'19.

I will give you one number. I mean the last 2 months, we deployed more radio base stations than we did in entire 2019. That's the pace we are up
to. So our footprint is just growing. And even though there's no people or spectators in the stadiums, with the super app with NFL, what we're
doing is, of course, we have 5G in the stadiums, and we can project that out. So you, as a user, you can get that experience by not being in the
stadium with 7 screens.

So I see we are continuing to do transformative things, and the whole ecosystem is around us. As you have seen, we're now up to 5 different sites
with Amazon commercially on the mobile edge compute. We're building a lot of great opportunities and transformative business transformations
with it.

So we are really excited about it, and we can see the consumers are excited about that as well. But we're augmenting every day, and I'm extremely
happy with our technology team are deploying this together with the fiber we're doing at the same time. So you will see more and more. We're
just augmenting the Ultra Wideband Network.

And as -- I just need to also state that, remember, we also launched our nationwide 5G, covering more than 200 million people, which is on par or
better than our 4G, which clearly is the best in the nation. As I said, we -- I'm not sure how many times have won the RootMetrics, J.D. Power, and
now we're adding that nationwide. So we feel really good about our situation when it comes to network and what we can give to our customers.

On the 5G Home, you're right, we are now on 8 cities. We have -- we're also augmenting, of course, those cities with Ultra Wideband, and we have
2 more cities before year-end. But I said before, I mean, there's no reason why any city that we have mobility in will not be a 5G Home city as well.

And now with the CPE that we came out with early in the fourth quarter, we also have a very compelling offering, very transformative, with a
self-install, with a CPE that is much more powerful than the previous ones, much easier to detect and all of that. So we feel good about that.

That doesn't change what we have said before when it comes to our revenue trajectory for 5G and the different business cases we have. But what
it shows is that we are really in execution mode right now and bringing monetization on top of our 5G investment that we have been on to for the
last 3, 4 years or as long as I remember because I have been here for 2.5 years because we have all the time been on this strategy.

So I'm very pleased with this third quarter. We have more to do in the fourth quarter, but a lot of things are coming in place for us right now to
really talk about our strategy.

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

I think I got 3 quick ones. First, the -- some strong service revenue growth guidance for the fourth quarter. What's driving what appears to be
accelerating migration to those higher-tiered, unlimited plans? That's number one.

Number two, given the earnings guidance and the fact that year-to-date, you have some slight earnings growth, it would appear that you're not
expecting much dilution in the fourth quarter from what we're seeing on the iPhone. And I guess, given the promotions out there, does that mean
that you don't expect a meaningful increase in overall volumes in the fourth quarter this year as we look versus last fourth quarter?

And then lastly, a follow-up to David's question. On the millimeter wave, obviously, inclusion in the iPhone would seem to be a big positive for you
guys from a competitive standpoint. Hans, is there any opportunity to go faster with that 5G deployment? I know you're doing 5x the small cells
that you did last year, but it would seem to be a nice competitive sort of advantage for you guys to get that out there as soon as possible. I'm just
wondering from a CapEx standpoint, does it make sense to go -- to put the pedal to the metal?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Let me start just hitting a little bit on service revenue and then millimeter wave, and then I will hand it over to Matt. So on the service
revenue, I just want to reiterate the strategy we have had now since we launched unlimited and the work that Ronan and the team are doing as
well as Tami when it comes to our Mix & Match, et cetera.

This has been a journey where we are differentiating our customer experience towards any of our competitors. I mean first of all, we can Mix &
Match. Number two, we have offerings with partners that no one else have, everything from Disney+ to Apple Music. We have just put a totally
different way of dealing with our customer. And thus, you see the payout.

And remember, in the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year, we were in a fantastic trajectory on the service revenue. Then we all know
what happened in the pandemic, and now we are showing that we're back. And as Matt said on the service revenue, we had better trajectory in
the month of August and in July and in September. So the guys are doing a great job. I will leave it back to Matt later on for the service revenue
comments, but that's how I feel about it, how good these guys are doing this.

On the millimeter wave, yes, I agree with you. We are just creating a competitive advantage with the whole millimeter wave and the Ultra Wideband.
And you can see that all the partners we're lining up are really excited about it, if it's Apple or if it's Wild Rift, which is the biggest game in the world
that will be exclusive with us. All of that is happening at the moment.

I'm pushing the team every day to go faster. Now we have also unconstrained supply. I mean we didn't have that last year when we were so early
on this. And some might not remember that the conviction or the word was that 5G will start to be deployed in 2020. We have commercial networks.
We have 55 cities. We're nationwide. And we have pushed the envelope of technology with ecosystem since 2015 to be where we are today.

But don't worry. I'm pushing, and I'm going to push as well, and we are managing this within our CapEx as well. So the team is doing well. We are
giving all the resources they need because we understand what competitive advantage we are creating. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans. So John, on the service revenue growth. So certainly, the migrations to unlimited are part of it. But if you look at the improvement
quarter-over-quarter, and I know there's a lot of focus on the consumer side, but I'll be remiss not to point out the improvement on the business
side as well.

Business service revenue increased from 3.1% growth in 2Q to 4.9% in 3Q, largely in public sector and small, medium business. And as good as our
market share is in consumer, it's even better in the business segment. So that continues to be a driver of service revenue.

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

But within the consumer side, certainly, continued migrations to unlimited. And as we continue to add value to the proposition, which you saw us
do with Mix & Match 3.0, we continue to see more customers migrate over. And not just migrating over, but more customers are migrating over
to the upper tiers of unlimited as well. We see more of our new accounts taking unlimited than we've ever seen. And we think there's continued
opportunities within the base to migrate people over and step them up further. So good trajectory on service revenue and headroom for even
more to come.

On the EPS guide, you're right. We feel good about where we'll be in the fourth quarter here, and you see that in the guide. And as you think about
the iPhone promos, while certainly, we think those are value creative for us, I'd also draw your attention to, especially on the consumer side, how
the accounting of those promos under the 606 accounting standard. The -- a large part of those promo costs will be amortized over the next 2.5
years or so rather than hitting the income statement upfront.

So from a 4Q standpoint, the iPhone promos are more of a working capital issue than they are an EPS issue. But as we think about the forward view,
that's all fully baked in and feel very good about where we should be in the current quarter and the jump-off point into '21. And even with an
increase in volumes coming through year-over-year, we expect to be accretive on EPS for the full year.

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Strong numbers on the Fios Internet side. Perhaps you could just unpack how much of this is the delays from the installation backlog from Q2?
And what's sort of the underlying trend both on adds going into Q4? And also, on ARPU, what sort of speed tiers are you seeing? Are people
upgrading within the Fios space there?

And then maybe, Hans, you could just speak to the broader economy. There is concerns that as some of the fiscal stimulus ends, we'll see more
small business closures, et cetera. What are you hearing from CIOs and others as you engage with them?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Hey, Simon, thanks for the question. I'll take the Fios one first. So look, a lot of great effort by the teams during the quarter. And what you really
have is a fantastic product and a fantastic team putting it out there. And you see the results: a 144,000 net adds on Internet in the quarter was our
best in almost 6 years.

There was a little bit of impact from working through the backlog from Q2. But I can tell you, even without that backlog impact, we'd have been
significantly north of 100,000. So it's -- while that was a factor, it wasn't the driving factor. The driving factor is the quality of the product, which
customers value now more than ever and combined with the Mix & Match product that we brought, the pricing proposition that we brought into
Fios from wireless in the early part of this year. And when you brought those things together, we're seeing great results.

So strong demand has continued into October. And I would expect we will see a normal level of seasonality in 4Q, where we see a little bit of a
drop-off in overall industry volumes and as you get towards the holiday season. But great to see us taking share again in the Fios world.

And again, it's just the combination of both the great product and you put it together with the Mix & Match construct, and it's really resonating in
the marketplace. So -- and then I think we still have room to grow there with a good amount of customers still with the opportunity to step up to
gigabit speeds.

OCTOBER 21, 2020 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

On the broader economy, I mean, I can only say 2 things: I mean first of all, I mean, the public sector customers and the large enterprise customers,
in general, very high activities. There are, of course, certain large enterprises that are a little bit subdued because there are industries that are having
very tough times, like the airline industry and tourism or transport.

So -- but all others, I would say the activity level is higher than ever. Many are taking advantage of digitalizations and actually changing the way
you're working. And this is playing straight into our strategy that we have been deploying for years, both with the technology but also with the
go-to-market we designed 2 years ago or 1.5 years ago.

And finally, I think the small and medium business, that's where we see the challenge because we still have companies that have closed down and
are waiting to see if they're going to get back. It's not getting worse, but we still have that concerns for small and medium businesses that are hard
to say. So when I talk around with my colleagues in the industry, the CEOs, they see the same a little bit.

We don't know where the small end business will go after this. It depends on how long this economical downturn will be, but we haven't seen a
worsening yet, at least lately. So that's where we are.

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

I want to ask a question about gross additions if I could. AT&T's promotion seems to be quite different than yours and T-Mobile's in that it's very
much focused on retention. And just given that gross adds are already down sharply and the cable industry is taking a good chunk of gross add
growth, how do you think about gross additions going into the fourth quarter and into 2021? Is there the potential that the market is sort of starved
of growth here, and that it forces a more competitive stance or a more aggressive stance from you in particular, but for the industry overall?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Craig, thanks for the question. I think the only thing I can say to that, I feel very good about our expectation for gross additions going into the fourth
quarter. We got the right combination of the best network, the great handsets out there, the right customer propositions. I think we'll do very well
from a gross addition standpoint here in 4Q.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

And if I could just ask a follow-up about the cable industry. Just the cable industry is now having -- has its own 5G promotions. How do we think
about 5G under the cable contract, the MVNO contracts that you have with the cable industry?

Is it fair to assume that you reopened the contract for special pricing? Just given that at least I think most people's understanding is that the original
contract was priced on a per gig basis of some kind, and that would be hard to do in millimeter wave, given the kinds of volumes that somebody
could run up.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Craig, first of all, as we all know, there large MVNOs in these countries together with us, and we are very happy with that. They are very good
customers to us. We have a good relationship with them. And they have been taking some share.

capital spend better than anybody else in this market. And I'm just happy to see that what's happening. I cannot go into any contractual things
we're doing. But again, we are happy. I guess they're happy as well. So that's how it works.

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

A few if I could. First, could you just break out the $0.05 of COVID dilution, where that would appear in the income statement during the quarter?

Secondly, as you described the cost-cutting program that's starting to get to the home stretch towards that $10 billion target by the end of '21,
where do the remaining savings come from in terms of the business activities? And is it an expense opportunity for savings or CapEx savings
opportunity?

And then just finally, on a more broad basis. I was just wondering if you can give us an update on how you see the importance of content bundles
in your wireless rate plans. And if there's any further development on the aspirations the management team has described to leverage the consumer
base for more bundling opportunities in the future?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes. Mike, so as you think about the $0.05 COVID impact in the quarter, down significantly from second quarter, obviously, $0.14 down to $0.05.
And we saw an improvement both on the wireless fees, especially on the usage side and also the media revenues. But within the $0.05, the biggest
item right now that's contributing to that is travel, TravelPass and roaming revenue. So most of the $0.05 impact is in the service revenue line in
the income statement. We think the number will be a little less than that in 4Q and continue to decline as we go forward. But obviously, TravelPass
will be an ongoing headwind for some time here.

As you think about the cost cutting, you said we're in the home stretch. I'm not sure I agree with that statement. We're certainly close to the $10
billion target. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we're not stopping there. And I see tremendous opportunities for us across the business, continue
to improve the efficiency of our processes and operations. And some of the changes that we've made during the course of the pandemic have only
shown us additional opportunities that are ahead of us. So we'll get to the $10 billion, and then we'll just keep on going.

And then finally, the importance of the content bundles you mentioned, the teams are always looking at the right way to bring the best value
proposition to our customers. And we're in a unique position, given the size of our customer base and the quality of our customer base. We're very
much the partner of choice for a lot of content providers. We're very happy to have bring the Disney bundle into the 3.0 construct. And if we see
other ways to bring value to our customers in a way that also brings value to us, we'll certainly continue to look for those. But we're very happy
with the pricing constructs and the overall value proposition we have in the marketplace today.

Doug Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD

I think the iPhone questions are taken. So Hans, my question is, it's kind of a funny one. How patient are you? You've had a singular focus on wireless
and 5G since you've taken over. It's a low interest rate environment, unprecedented bond market, capital is cheap. You're intensely focused on
wireless leadership. So how long is your investment horizon?

If you see a great investment opportunity, maybe a large and onetime opportunity, does it have to cover what is now a bit lower cost of capital in
3 years, 7 years, 10 years? How do you think about investing in terms of time frame, Hans?

And Matt, sort of paired with that, same question on the balance sheet. You mentioned the idea of getting to your target leverage over time. And
again, the debt markets are so attractive right now. I would think that would give you more balance sheet flexibility and elongate the time frame
by which you might need to hit that target range.

How do you want investors to think about what over time means? Is that a year or 3 years?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

On the first question, first of all, I'm happy that we've answered all the iPhone question because that's an important piece for us, because it was
such an important event for us last week. So thank you for that.

On the horizon on investment, they're, of course, different depending on what we're investing. And so it's hard to just make an answer. But clearly,
we are trying to monetize as quickly as we can on all the investments we're doing. And that's why we're talking so much about the monetization
right now as we have done quite a lot in the network, all the way from the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and with all the 5G. And all the 5G use
cases that we outlined, the 3 business cases are now up, running commercially.

So now it's up to our sales team to sell. I mean it's Ronan, it's Tami, it's Guru, the 3 CEOs that now needs to get out with a sales force to sell on it.
Because, Kyle, which is running the technology, has bumped this network up to something that we have never seen before. So that's how I see it.
So it's really execute right now.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Doug, on the balance sheet flexibility, I mean, we -- our capital allocation model continues to be what we're aiming towards. And we're very happy
with the progress we've made on the balance sheet. It gives us the flexibility and the agility to pursue opportunities as they come up. As you've
seen that even in the course of this year, we've done with BlueJeans, with TracFone and certainly with the spectrum transactions that have taken
place already this year. So that will continue to be our focus to have that target, and we'll get there as quick as we can. But no change to how we're
thinking about capital allocation.

Doug Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD

Right. If you wouldn't mind me sort of adding a follow-up to that, Hans, when should investors expect to see a material level of 5G revenue, given
all your efforts on that front? Is there sort of a time frame or a year we should think about where we're going to go, aha, there it is.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

As we outlined, I think already 2018, when it comes to 5G Home and mobility, we would start seeing something in 2021. And then 5G mobile edge
compute is for 2022. That's what we said already, I think, at the Investor Day at 2018 or '17. So we stick to that, and we execute on it. And this team,
they are a phenomenal group of executors I have here in Verizon.

The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays.

Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst

So a couple, if I could. I mean the first is, Hans, I mean, on TracFone, could you just contextualize the objective, why the change of heart in prepay,
with respect to prepaid? Is it more a commentary on the macro environment and the saturation levels in the industry? Or is it more from the
perspective of an origination pipeline? Obviously, the deal is accretive financially, but strategically, what's the broader goals that you're hoping to
solve with that?

And secondly, I guess there's been a lot of headline last couple of days around the Google payment to carriers. And the amount seems meaningful
enough, and it's pure margins for the most part. So if you could just help us understand how big revenue streams from application providers are
and where that shows up in your P&L, that might be helpful.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. On the TracFone, our strategic intent is, of course, going back to the Network-as-a-Service and seeing that we monetize the network in the
best way. And of course, the value segment is a growing segment that is also giving us growth.

So we are hitting on 2 of the main objectives here: one is, of course, to monetize our network better than anybody else in this market and the capital
invested; and secondly, be part of the growth and seeing that we are actually playing in all different segments of the market when it comes to
wireless. So that's the objective.

And as you might know, the majority of these customers on TracFone, they're already on our network. So that's -- we have the synergies from it.
But clearly, that's how we see it. But we need to close it first. We have said that it's in the second half of 2021. So it's a while until we get there. So
we will definitely give you more updates on that as we go on. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, Kannan, there's a certain amount of revenue that we get from application providers, but it's not a material part of the overall revenue stream.

Your last question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Can you give us some color on how many fixed wireless subs you think you can have kind of longer term? And what -- when do we kind of ramp
up to kind of full ability to add kind of customers on a monthly basis? What do you think that run rate would look like?

We have said we're going to address 30 million households over the 5 to 8 years. That's where we -- what we're addressing. And hopefully -- not
hopefully, our ambition is to take a fair market share of that one as we have done with the Fios. So that's what we're pushing for.

And our team is always geared to do better than the expectations. So of course, we are pushing them hard. And as we are releasing more and more
sites and more and more homes for sale, we're going to start reporting it.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

And how important is the new equipment? How much better is it? And how easy is it to install?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

It is a step change. I would say, it's clearly a step change when it comes to both the self-install, but also how much more we can cover with that
CPE because it's is bringing in so much more of the signal compare.

Remember, the first CPE we had was basically a smartphone chipset sitting in the CPE. That's what we had. So basically, we had a smartphone being
the CPE. This is catered for being indoor or outdoor CPE. And as we have reported before, we have a lot of indoor installations right now because
this is working very well. So it's a step change and mainly because we can address so many more households from one radio base station. That's
the importance of it.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Tim. That's all the time we have today. Everybody, be safe, and have a great week.

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's take a look at the consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.55 per share on a GAAP
basis. Reported results include a net pretax gain on the sale of Verizon Media of $706 million and a net pretax charge of approximately $247 million,
which includes a net charge of $144 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for pension liabilities and $103 million related to a severance
charge for voluntary separations under our existing plan. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41 in the
third quarter compared to $1.25 a year ago. Please note, our results include 2 months of Verizon Media as the sale to Apollo Funds closed on
September 1.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the third quarter.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. We had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless
service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth. This was supported by strong net additions in wireless and broadband, which are
both translated to bottom line growth. This definitely confirms our strategy to grow our business with high-quality offerings.

As I said throughout the year, we have all the assets we need to extend our #1 position in the market. Our strategy remains unchanged, and we're
delivering on everything we promised. And we're gaining momentum on all 5 vectors of growth.

We have more paths to grow than anybody else, and we're confident with our growth targets for outer years based on our third quarter and
continued momentum into the fourth quarter. As an evidence, we're updating financial guidance for the full year. We now expect total wireless
service revenue growth of around 4%, which is on the high end of our prior guidance and adjusted EPS of $5.35 to $5.40, up from $5.25 to $5.35.
We remain on track to achieve our targeted CapEx levels in 2021, assuming no further disruption in the supply chain.

Our team is working diligently and doing a fantastic work with vendors and suppliers to ensure we have adequate equipment to meet our C-Band
build and that we have devices that our customers want.

Our operational excellence and our partnership strategy is the best in the industry, which I have been so impressed by since I joined Verizon. And
in times like this, it matters.

Let's talk about business. We continue to provide the best-in-class experience across the board. On the network front, third parties continue to
recognize us as the best network experience. This includes RootMetrics for the 16th consecutive time and J.D. Power for the 27th consecutive time.
Our network team is doing a great job.

On the commercial front, we've got great momentum in the 5G adoption, with over 25% of our consumer phone base using a 5G-capable device.
This is tracking well ahead of the 4G adoption, as I've said before.

For context, 12 months after 4G launch, 10% of the devices were on 4G. Less than 12 months after 5G DSS launched, more than the double were
on 5G devices, and it's growing at a rapid pace. This, combined with our mmWave strategy, is an important combination, and that is paying off. In
the third quarter, the total mmWave users more than doubled sequentially. We're doing more gigabit of users in a month now than we did in all
of the first quarter. In some of our more established build-outs, we're seeing more than 20% of users on mmWave. And we are on track to have 5%
to 10% of all traffic in the urban mmWave polygons by year-end.

For our Business segment, we continue to add wireless subscribers and take broadband share in our ILEC footprint with Fios. And finally, we
delivered significant value creation and strategy refinement with the sale of the Verizon Media Group in September, the pending TracFone acquisition
and also the issuance of our third green bond, which is a vital step towards our net zero goal in 2035. All this was accomplished in tandem with a
strong quarter results.

When it comes to the financials, we're on track to meet and exceed all our 2021 guidance. We expect to have a strong finish of the year as we
approach the launch of C-Band.

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

We continue to deliver excellent revenue performance in wireless service and within Fios. We have a diversified path to revenue growth with all 5
vectors contributing.

EBITDA was up 3.3% year-over-year. And on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 12.8%. Our capital allocation stands firm. We invest in our business to
create shareholder value. We continue to increase our dividend, which we did for the 15th consecutive year. And Matt and team are working
diligently on our debt reduction. As we said last quarter, our guidance raise is broad-based and across all our 5 vectors of growth.

Consumer segment EBITDA increased by 2% driven by positive trends in customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, product and services and
content as well as prepaid and reseller growth. The service revenue momentum in the third quarter was driven by continued execution of our
migration strategy to higher-valued price plans as well as high-quality net adds.

But our growth is more than that. Much of our long-term growth is in fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute. Our strategy is becoming a
national broadband provider with the best access to the tech for our customers including Fios, fixed wireless access on 5G, 4G, mmWave and
C-Band.

When it comes to the mobile edge compute, we are the mobile edge compute leader, both in public and private, thanks to great partnerships.
And we just announced a private mobile edge compute partnership with Amazon that we're pleased with. And this just scratches the surface on
how we'll continue to utilize our assets. We're confident in our growth opportunities as we move into the investment cycle with C-Band.

Before I hand it over to Matt, I want to briefly touch on our broadband expansion. We are on track to meet our fixed wireless access household
coverage targets with an expected 15 million homes passed by the end of the year between 4G and 5G. To date, 5G Home is in 57 markets, and
the 4G LTE home in over 200 markets across all 50 states.

In addition to fixed wireless access, we're pleased with the great performance of Fios and continue to grow the open for sales volumes within our
footprint. We're on track on exceeding all the commitments for 2021 and on track for long-term growth expectations outlined in our Investor Day
earlier this year. You can expect us to provide 2022 guidance during our Q4 '21 earnings call.

And now Matt, over to you.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered
strong financial and operating performance.

As we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth as a goal in itself but on high-value volume growth that will yield sustainable
increases in revenue and profitability going forward. By delivering the best-in-class network experiences to customers with additional services and
products like Disney+ that others can't provide, our strategy is focused on increasing the value we receive from every connection.

As you can see from our results, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. In the third quarter, consolidated total
revenue was $32.9 billion, up 4.3% from prior year. Our results are inclusive of 2 months of Media revenue, which approximated $1.4 billion on a
segment basis. Excluding Verizon Media, total revenue grew 5.5%.

Our service and other revenue growth rate was 0.5% and 1.6% without Verizon Media. Equipment revenue growth was approximately 30% compared
to the prior year mainly due to the timing of iconic device launches and the continued pandemic recovery.

Fios revenue was $3.2 billion, up 4.7% year-over-year driven by continued growth in customers as well as our efforts to increase the value of each
customer by encouraging them to step up in speed tiers. Total wireless service revenue, which is the sum of Consumer and Business, was $17.1
billion, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year. The results were driven by higher access revenue, volume growth and products. We are creating
more paths to growth with connectivity and non-connectivity services.

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $12.3 billion, up 3.3% from prior year. Top line growth and a reduction in non-equipment-related expenses
contributed to the year-over-year EBITDA growth. And net EBITDA growth is helping us drive EPS growth. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.41,
up year-over-year by 12.8%.

Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on bringing in high-quality net adds, a key
component in helping us continue to deliver strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.

We are seeing strong demand for connectivity across our Consumer and Business units. Our Mix & Match value propositions, network quality and
unique partnerships are resonating with both new and existing customers.

For the quarter, we delivered 429,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, up more than 50% from prior year and in line with 2019 levels. We're
seeing growth in new accounts as well as high retention levels, allowing us to grow our base with high-quality net adds.

Phone churn for the quarter was 0.74%, well below pre-pandemic levels. Churn continues to benefit from a number of sustainable factors, including
our best-in-class network with unmatched reliability and coverage and overall value propositions within our Consumer and Business unlimited
plans. Additionally, consumer payment patterns continue to be better than pre-pandemic norms.

Total broadband net adds, defined here as Fios, DSL and fixed wireless, were 129,000. Fios Internet net adds were 104,000 compared to 144,000
last year. As a reminder, last year's 3Q Fios results included a benefit from a higher backlog entering the quarter as we had largely paused in stores
in Q2 2020 due to COVID. Fios has continued momentum driven by our best-in-class value proposition, built on network quality and our Mix and
Match pricing structure. This combination is helping us to take share and deliver historically low churn rates.

For the first time, we are providing fixed wireless net adds, which include both Consumer and Business fixed wireless products. We are building
momentum and our pre-C-Band success in Q3 demonstrates there is demand for the product from consumers and businesses.

Both our 5G and LTE fixed wireless products are performing very well. We're pleased with what we're seeing around the install process as well as
the quality and reliability of the product.

Now let's turn to our Consumer Group results. Our Consumer Group had another strong quarter, continuing the momentum that we've been seeing
in wireless and Fios. Total revenue was $23.3 billion, up 7.3% year-over-year. Service and other revenue was $18.8 billion, an improvement of 2.5%
versus prior year. These results include strong wireless revenue as well as growth in Fios.

Fios revenue was $2.9 billion, up 4.3% year-over-year mainly driven by growth in our Internet base of approximately 400,000 or 6.2% over the past
year and migration to higher speeds. Our actions around Mix and Match, which included broadband-first approach, is helping us to grow Fios
revenue and consumer EBITDA. We still see plenty of room for additional growth within Fios as we continue to increase our share, Mix and Match
penetration rates and our open-for-sale locations.

Wireless service revenue was $14 billion, up 4% from the prior year. We have been driving access gains, both in growing accounts and phone net
adds as well as by continuing to execute on our migration strategy. As a result of migrations and step-ups, over 30% of our account base is now
on premium unlimited plans.

Our growth in access is being complemented by product revenue, which includes items such as protection plans, content and others. Our wide
range of product offerings helps us to not only grow revenue but provides differentiated experiences and more value to our customers.

For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year or more than $200 million driven by our high-quality service and other revenue
gains coming from multiple growth vectors. These results show the impact of our strategy to enhance the value of each connection, which we
believe will drive continued growth into the future.

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

The Mix and Match pricing structure for both wireless and Fios provides tremendous opportunity to migrate customers to higher-value tiers and
bring in customers on higher-value plans. We are very pleased with how this strategy is working to help us increase value from our base and from
new customers. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout our results.

Postpaid phone net adds were 267,000, above our Q3 performance in 2019 and 2020. The performance was consistent during the period as we
were able to grow accounts and deliver sustainably low churn throughout the quarter.

Most importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the quality of customers we're adding, with approximately 66% of new accounts taking a
premium unlimited plan. And Q3 was another quarter in which we saw a strong acceleration in our 5G penetration, exiting the quarter with over
25% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G-capable device, which is great progress in advance of our launch of 5G service on C-Band spectrum
in the coming months.

Fios Internet net adds were 98,000 for the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing,
especially on retention.

Now let's move to Slide 11 to review the Business Group results. Our Business segment continues to see strong demand for wireless services across
multiple verticals. We are continuing to focus on what we believe will be the highest growth portions of the Business segment: our small and
medium business unit, private wireless and the MEC space for enterprise customers as well as building momentum for fixed wireless access to
serve multiple customer groups.

Total revenue for the Business segment was $7.7 billion. We continue to see growth in wireless revenue being offset by ongoing legacy wireline
declines. Wireless service revenue was $3.1 billion, up 3.6% year-over-year. We saw quarter-over-quarter expansion driven by small and medium
business, which was partially offset by distance learning pressures in public sector.

Wireline revenues continue to be pressured by secular trends, while also facing elevated year-over-year comps due to 2020 COVID spending.

Consistent with our focus on driving high-value business, in the wholesale space, we continue to rationalize our international voice traffic, which
is contributing to the revenue decline shown on the slide.

Business segment EBITDA was $1.9 billion, down 2.4% from the same quarter last year, and Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.8% in the
quarter.

While secular trends within wireline will continue to put pressure on margins in the near term, we're encouraged by the growth opportunities
associated with our business transformation efforts as they start to gain traction.

Our market leadership in wireless across all customer groups and our continued investment in primary growth areas for Verizon Business Group
will position us to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the future. We are encouraged by the results we delivered for the highest-value
portions of the segment in 3Q.

Phone gross add volumes were above pre-pandemic levels, up 11.4% year-over-year and up 3% versus the same quarter in 2019. Total postpaid
net adds for the quarter were 276,000.

To better highlight some of the trends, on this slide, we've broken out the net adds by public sector and our higher-growth commercial businesses,
which include small and medium business and enterprise. During 3Q 2020, the commercial space primarily within small and medium business was
depressed, while public sector buoyed by distance learning programs saw elevated net adds.

In 3Q '21, we've seen a rebound in the commercial space, while distance learning disconnects have driven public sector volumes to lower levels.
We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter. A portion of distance learning disconnects also impacted our phone churn and net
add performance. Despite this, we delivered postpaid phone net adds of 162,000.

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operating
activities totaled $31.2 billion. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by lower cash taxes last year from a onetime benefit and higher
working capital requirements this year due to greater volumes.

Year-to-date capital spending totaled $13.9 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and
capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $1 billion through the third quarter. And we have placed orders for
approximately $2 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously guided incremental CapEx
range of $2 billion to $3 billion for the year as we accelerate our C-Band deployment.

The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is $17.3 billion of free cash flow for the 9-month period. Net unsecured debt at
quarter end was $131.6 billion, a $5.2 billion decrease versus the prior quarter. In addition to our third green bond issuance, we extended over $4.6
billion of near-term debt into a new 2032 maturity as we continue to optimize borrowing costs and our debt profile. Our net unsecured debt to
adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.7x.

Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $9.9 billion, which included the proceeds associated with our sale of Verizon Media Group. We
expect lower levels of cash on hand as we progress through the fourth quarter and approach the close of the TracFone acquisition, while continuing
to execute our business strategy within our capital allocation framework.

Let's move on to Slide 14 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. We continued our strong first half performance and momentum
in the third quarter. Hans and I are very pleased with the hard work our team is putting forth, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie
ahead as we prepare for the C-Band launch.

Our strong year-to-date results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter are allowing us to update guidance on both wireless service
revenue growth and EPS. Wireless service revenue growth is now expected to be around 4.0%, the high end of the prior guidance.

Adjusted EPS guidance is being increased from $5.35 to $5.40, up from the prior range of $5.25 to $5.35. Our guidance for the effective tax rate is
unchanged. CapEx guidance is also unchanged, though I'd note that our assumption for our BAU spend of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion is dependent
upon no material changes in the current state of our supply chain.

Our team continues to execute on our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results. We are attracting high-quality customers that
see value in our products and services, evidenced by growth in accounts, migrations and step-ups. I look forward to continued momentum as we
wrap up the year and position our base to take full advantage of all the things 5G Built Right has to offer.

With that, I will hand it over to Hans to wrap up our prepared remarks.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. As you heard, we delivered solid third quarter results, and we are on track to meet or exceed all our 2021 commitment to the
investment community. Our strategy is working. And I'm confident in the strategy we have to deliver both strong results and premium experiences
going forward.

As we look ahead, we'll continue to focus on expanding our 5G leadership, capitalizing on wireless momentum and work towards our C-Band
launch, deploying differentiating experiences for our customers and execute our Network-as-a-Service strategy, delivering all 5 vectors of growth.
And we look forward to delivering on all fronts and sharing our results in the coming months.

With that, I hand it back to Brady.

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Hans, you discussed continued momentum into the fourth quarter, and I see you recently pulled back on the more aggressive retention plans. Can
you talk about what competition looks like in Consumer right now? And any shift in underlying demand?

And then second for Matt. Given the strong performance in the recurring revenue businesses, does it make sense to be less aggressive on reducing
leverage and maybe allocate some free cash flow to buybacks, given the low multiple on the stock?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Phil. Let me start with the competitive landscape. Yes, there is, of course, a little bit more competitive landscape right now. But let me
remind you on a couple of things.

First of all, as we have learned from the history, broadband and mobilities, 2 of the most important infrastructure for any person in this country
and in the world. So it's not strange that there is competition here.

Secondly, we are in a moment where 5G is scaling, the economy is strong. So of course, that's the moment where we see a lot of competition. But
anyhow, if you look at our numbers, we are competing extremely effectively. We're gaining the high-quality customers regardless of the type of
competition we have.

And not only that, I mean, if you look at our growth of 3.9%, we feel really good about that as well when it comes to our service revenue. And we
have been going back and forth on our promos. And the reason is that Ronan and his team on the Consumer side, they look at long-term profitability,
high-quality customers when they come in and doing a promo. And right now, we feel very good about how we compete in the market. So we're
always going to have promos when we think it's the right timing of it. So we feel really good about it.

And as you also saw that Matt talked about our increased guidance as well. So all in all, we feel good how we compete in this environment. And if
you look at the track record the last couple of quarters, been really strong in Consumer. And Ronan and the whole team are doing a great job. So
I feel good about that.

When it comes to the capital allocation, I'll let -- I can just say that we -- our capital allocation is clear. I mean, we focus #1 on investing in business,
and we are investing in the business this year and both in CapEx, the spectrum and all of that. So that's #1.

But we also have, as I said, our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase. And Matt and I, we constantly see that we have a position for the Board
so they can continue to do that, and we will continue to do that. And then we have our debt reduction, which Matt will talk about.

And finally, we have buybacks that we can do all the time. What I can tell you is that we constantly have a conversation with the Board which is the
best way of doing capital allocation, the priorities. And we'll continue to do so to see that our shareholders get the best out of Verizon. Matt?

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Hans, I think you hit on the key points there. Look, we're always going to look at the pillars of our capital allocation policy. And right now, we
continue to see a lot of opportunities to invest in our business.

You see what we're doing there around the C-Band investment, for example, not just for spectrum but also the CapEx associated with that. Obviously,
we said long term, we do believe deleveraging is the right priority. But we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders, and you saw that
with the dividend. So Phil, you should expect us to continue to be thoughtful about capital allocation as we go forward.

Operator

The next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Great. Thanks so much for the disclosure on fixed wireless. That's great to see. Perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on the economics
of the product. Is this a similar ARPU to a smartphone? Are we looking at mostly LTE? Or is this a mix of LTE and mmWave?

And then perhaps just coming back to the C-Band. I think you said before, 7,000 to 8,000 towers this year, getting to 100 million covered POPs by
the first quarter. Perhaps you'd just update us on that? And then how quickly do you really turn that into an expansion of your fixed wireless
footprint? Does the marketing really start coincident with that? Or is that a steady ramp during the year?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Simon. On the fixed wireless access, yes, you're right, it's a similar ARPU on fixed wireless access as on our mobility. And also when it
comes to the numbers we have, as you said, it's a mix of 4G. It's mmWave in the fixed wireless access right now. And as I said before, when we talk
about our 5G fixed wireless access, the usage on the network is very similar as of Fios. So they are even using more gigabytes on the fixed wireless
access on 5G than they do on Fios.

So -- and we have a very, very good performance and quality. And remember, on the fixed wireless access, we are also doing a, I would say, a
different model with the self-install and all of that, making optionality for our customers.

And ultimately, the vision is clear for Verizon. We're going to be a nationwide broadband provider. We're going to have different accesses in different
places depending on what is right for the customers and how quickly we can deploy.

So -- and we are investing in the Fios and you saw the numbers this month. I mean, we're adding 130,000 in this quarter when it -- or 129,000, to
be exact, net adds in broadband. So this is a great business for us, and we're just ramping fixed wireless access.

And then coming back to C-Band, as soon as we turn on C-Band, we're also going to augment the footprint that we can offer fixed wireless access.
So -- and as we said in the opening remarks, we're on track for that to deliver the -- after 1 year, having 100 million POPs covered by the C-Band.

As I said, there are some challenges in supply chain, but I can only say the team is just doing an enormous work. And just to be clear on it, the
long-term planning we have with our vendors, the projection of forecasting we have done for all our equipment vendors over 2 years before we
start deploying, of course, it's paying off right now that we work very differently with our vendors and how we plan. We have also pooled resources
and inventory higher in the network so we can easily see that we have access to it. So we have done a lot of things in the last 2 years, 3 years in
supply chain, so we can be in a situation to mitigate challenges we have right now. So all in all, that's where we are. Matt?

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, Simon, I think Hans has summed it up well there. We've got good momentum in the fixed wireless business there. You saw the 55,000 net
adds in the quarter. That means we're approximately 150,000 total subscribers on fixed wireless access at the end of the quarter. Good momentum
being built there. And as Hans said, as soon as we turn on C-Band, immediately be adding that to the technologies that we're selling on fixed
wireless access. So good momentum buildup and then we've got that extra turbo boost to come here in the next few weeks.

Operator

The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

Just actually a follow-up here on your broadband business. You mentioned you're getting a mix of both LTE and 5G subscribers. I'm curious who
are these customers? Specifically, are you upselling into existing accounts? Or are these primarily new relationships for Verizon?

And then it's also notable that you are continuing to expand the Fios footprint. It looks like you're going to add over 400,000 locations open for
sale this year, and it seems like you would expect to be at or above that pace going forward. You really hadn't edged out that footprint for a long
time. Why have you decided to do that now? How big could the Fios footprint be? And is all of this happening in your region? Or are you actually
doing some of this out of region?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. On the customers on fixed wireless access, I would say there are probably roughly half and half. Half, meaning coming from our existing base
and half were taken from other suppliers. That's basically how they come in right now. And let's see how the mix going forward.

But here, we have the optionality that we've talked about before. And we have the owners' economics to work with convergence if that's what our
customers want to have. We basically have all of those optionalities right now. And I feel really good about that.

And then the second question on the Fios footprint. We have constantly, of course, deployed Fios, and in this -- in our ILEC to be honest. And what
we see right now is very strong demand, and we're winning the business we're deploying. The team is deploying. And as I said, we are heading
towards 400,000 open for sale this year. And we will continue with that because we see a great demand, and our win share is extremely strong in
the Fios footprint.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So just a couple of things I'd add there, Brett. On the mixture of the customers, as Hans mentioned, a good mix of 50-50 kind of split there
between new and existing customers. But also, I'd comment that a good mix, a good split between not just it being in rural areas and so on, but
also seeing good traction in suburban and urban areas, too, for those products.

And when you think about those customers in the first 46 C-Band markets that will come online, the customers taking the LTE product there are
getting a router that also has C-Band in so they can immediately step-up to those speeds when -- as soon as we turn C-Band on there soon.

And the Fios expansion, it's -- there's a couple of pieces. We see great opportunity, as Hans mentioned. The other piece, it's a great cost opportunity
as well as we continue to upgrade the network technology in that footprint as well.

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

So we've been investing in that for a number of years. Maybe haven't spoken about it quite as much, but it continues to be a very good growth
driver for the business. And we see a very strong line of sight for it to continue to do so. 4.7% growth in Fios revenues this quarter, certainly something
we can continue to build on.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

If you don't mind as a quick follow-up there around the cost point. Those of us who live in regions that have Fios know that sometimes you can
get Fios or maybe down the street, you can't. Are you kind of completing the communities? In other words, are you going to be at the point where
you can finally rip out all this legacy infrastructure? Is that what you meant by the cost savings?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Well, that's absolutely part of it. Now we're going to be all the way there. That's a long-term goal for us. But certainly, as you replace in a certain
location copper with fiber, there's a good benefit from a cost standpoint. In addition to the revenue step-up opportunities you get with that
customer base. So it's a win-win on both sides of the P&L there.

Operator

The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Just a couple of follow-ups on the -- again, on the C-Band deployment. First of all, are you seeing any supply chain or labor shortage issues with
the -- and that may affect the timing of that rollout?

And then beyond that, thanks for the 15 million sort of home passed with fixed wireless by year-end. Can you give us a sense of what the C-Band
deployment, the sort of first phase of that, what that will do to that number? Do you -- as that gets launched, you turn on a number of more homes?

And then lastly, can you give us a sense of how your sort of go-to-market strategy will change? And do you expect the C-Band deployment to
change the trajectory of your net adds, both on a fixed and mobile basis when we see that early next year?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

On the C-Band, as I said before, there are, of course, challenges in supply chain, but our team has -- I think our team is the most outstanding
operational excellence team in the world, and they are getting around all of it. On all major equipment, radios, et cetera, that are already secured.
This is in a warehouse, and that's how we work.

I mean, we do long-term planning with our suppliers years back. So we feel really good about that. There's been some challenges in the material.
The team is working around them every day, finding new solutions in order for us to deploy, and they will continue to do so.

When it comes to resources, again, we secured our resources years ahead to be prepared for these type of deployments we have. And we're doing
more deployment than we've ever done before.

You talk about C-Band. We do mmWave, 14,000 this year. We do fiber. We do augmentations on the 4G. We do Fios. The team -- so it's many things
they're doing, and we have never done more than this. And I can tell you the team with supply chain and deployment are doing a great job.

When it comes to the 15 million households passed by year-end this year, that includes all the technologies we have. And of course, the second
part that we guided for when we had our Investor Day was to get to 50 million households passed later on. So that includes all the technologies,
including C-Band, of course, and also how we deal with different type of devices, having all the different technology in them.

So the team has been planning this, creating opportunities for us. And of course, without coming into '22 -- 2022 yet, but with the opening of the
C-Band, we see great new opportunities. And as I said also at the Investor Day, that means we can accelerate and amplify our business cases on
5G. That was the whole thing with the C-Band, and the team is geared up for that and very focused.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

So just following up on the bit about the open, the households covered. As you saw in the prepared remarks, we're at 11.6 million at the end of
the third quarter. Obviously, we'll continue to add some mmWave and 4G for the rest of the year, but C-Band certainly will get us well over the 15
million as we turn that on.

Operator

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

I just wanted to return, Hans, to the competitive landscape. I guess, year-over-year, I think most observers would say that the promotions kind of
look very similar as they did a year ago. And if anything, the wireless landscape is probably less competitive now than it's ever been in terms of
postpaid phone net add availability. And as we look ahead, I think the things that people wonder about what's going to change are as the EBB and
the PPP and the renovated programs all go away, the super normal kind of sport for the postpaid market might ebb.

And second, you've got the cable companies coming in with new pricing plans.

And then third, we've got the DISH launch coming up. Could you kind of give us your perspective on how comfortable people should be about
how the landscape is going to evolve as these things change?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, there's a lot of moving parts here, as you talked about again. I mean, I think that what we have -- and now as we start with Consumer
because remember also our strong position on wireless on the Business side. And basically, we are leading in every segment. So sometimes we
forget to talk about how strong we're there.

But let me start with Consumer because I think your question is a little bit more geared to Consumer. Remember how we have built our [possibility].
First of all, we have the best network. We have kept the best network. We augmented, and we are, of course, adding more spectrum to it right now
with C-Band. So that's very important.

The second part is that the value we are doing besides having the best network, of course, with all the offerings we have created over time with
Discovery, Disney+, which all of them are giving us profitability and retention. And you see the share numbers in this quarter.

I think we have found a model with Mix and Match, and the things that we are offering our customers on the wireless side has really paid off with
both the loyalty but also the step-ups. And remember, when Matt talked about that we are now 1/3 of all the unlimited, be on unlimited premium,
but we still have, let's say, 1/3 on metered plan as well.

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

So we have so many steps to continue to move our customers upwards. And that has been a strategy from the beginning. And it's clearly different
than anybody else in the market how we can do that and both offer the best network and the experiences that we have as well as the Mix and
Match that we have in the network.

So I feel good about regardless of what type of competition is there and how it changes. We have owners' economics of everything we're doing.
That was very clear from the beginning. We build our own fiber. We have the full network, and that's why we can have MVNOs on the network,
which we also are benefiting from.

So the whole idea with the strategy we laid out is just playing straight into what's happening in the market where mobility and broadband is the
essential infrastructure for every individual in the world at the moment. And hey, everybody wants to be here. We have the best assets. That's
basically how it looks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. A couple of other points, Dave, if I can. So you mentioned the EBB impact on the marketplace. And certainly, we're supportive of all efforts to
make digital connectivity available and accessible to everyone in the country, and we're participating in those programs.

I would, though, say that in terms of our gross adds and new customers coming in, it's a very small portion of that. The majority of our EBB participation
is with existing customers rather than new customers. So it's not a driver of gross adds for us.

And you also kind of mentioned it. Obviously, in the marketplace, there's been new plans that have come to the market in the past 6 to 9 months.
And what I would say is just look at the volumes we've had, especially in the last 2 quarters with those new plans in place. You see the high-quality
volumes that we've put on in that environment. So you have to work across both the service revenue and the handset components of the offering
to customers. You add in the other values and products and services that we bring to customers, too.

This is the strategy that we've been working on for 2 to 3 years now. Obviously, it was a bit of a dip when we hit the pandemic, but the strategy
was driving revenue growth before the pandemic. And you see it driving revenue growth now as we continue to focus on high-quality customers
and increasing the value of our base, and it shows in the results.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

And if I could just quick follow-up, Matt. As we look at the implied performance in business wireline, is a portion of that related to Verizon's willingness
to be more aggressive on price and throw more elbows to hang on to customers knowing that enterprise relationships are the groundwork for
potential new wireless relationships as we think about enterprise 5G?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, I think there's a couple of items when you look at the wireline part of the business revenue results for the quarter that are not related to
what you mentioned. One, last year, during COVID, we saw a little bit of a step-up in some of the core voice data revenue that we hadn't seen in
quite a while. We're now lapping that, and those volumes are returning to their pre-pandemic trends.

The other thing is we've stepped out of some of the wholesale international voice business that had revenue but not significant margins associated
with it. So we wanted to focus on value-driving activities. We continue to compete effectively in the enterprise space in wireline. But on the quality
and reliability of the service we provide, obviously, we aim to be competitive there. But I'm not -- I've not seen us do anything out of the ordinary
of what we were doing previously.

And as you mentioned, those relationships are very important to us as we go into the 5G era. And we're really seeing those relationships pay off
with the work being done, working through those opportunities in MEC with a broad array of enterprise customers.

Operator

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Two questions if I could. First, I'm curious if you're seeing any impacts of inflation on your cost structure. And related to that, what are the opportunities
and the specific products where Verizon could try to pass through any increase in input costs and get better pricing?

Second question, just taking the reaffirmation today that Verizon wants to be a national broadband provider for homes, businesses and on the go,
how are you evaluating that build-versus-buy decision of using your spectrum and 5G technology to introduce fixed wireless broadband services
versus the possibility of acquiring cable and fiber assets in the future?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can start with the second question. Matt will answer on the inflation. When it comes to our rollout of nationwide broadband and playing with
that, of course, remember, we are doing a lot of fiber already right now. I mean, we're doing -- remember, we have been reporting on our One Fiber
project, which is still ongoing. In the most metropolitan areas, we are building on fiber. And of course, that is setting us up to have owner's economics
on the broadband.

And then at the access point, we will do a different type of 4G accesses. That's what new. The reason we do that because they're so much faster
when it comes to coming out to the customer. And we want to be innovative as well and having a self-install and all of that combined with it.

Then we're always on our fiber when it comes from outside our ILEC, we have looked into buy versus build all the time. We have come to the
conclusion we want to build. We built our One Fiber network because we wanted the owner's economics on fiber. So that work is already done.
So we feel really good about it.

We're going to have owner's economics nationwide on broadband over time here. And we can work with our wireless offering, our broadband
offering. We created the 2 go-to-market Verizon Consumer and Business Group thinking about our customers, how they do products, how to do
platforms, the user experience. This all comes into play right now. I mean, I couldn't be more excited than I am right now because the momentum
for mobility and broadband is happening.

We have prepared and worked now for 3 years to get where we are. And yes, we -- I feel really good about what we have. And the strategy is really
working. And we look at the last couple of quarters here, when we talk about our net additions, talking about the revenue growth.

And as I also said when we spoke earlier, I mean, if you look at the second quarter, when everybody has reported, we also take the larger share of
industry service and other revenue growth in the market. I mean, that's really what we're focusing on. We're focusing on getting the revenue
growth.

And that's a little bit of the answer to your question on inflation as well that Matt is going to soon take over. Of course, we still have a lot on the
wireless side where we can migrate customers up to higher plans. And that's, of course, the best way to see that we are getting incremental revenues
from our customers but also give them more value and experiences.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Mike, certainly, we are seeing inflation in our business here. How long that lasts? Obviously, we're going to have to wait and
see, and we're monitoring that closely.

But we're seeing that come across in certainly in labor rates. We're seeing it in commodities, driving utilities and whatnot. So -- but that's why the
things we've done on the cost side over the past few years and continue to do are so important because it gives us the opportunity to be able to
handle those -- any of those pressures coming in and continue to produce good margins. So we will continue to be focused there.

And then as Hans said, our opportunity on the pricing side is really to step customers up. If you've got direct costs out there that we can pass
through that we certainly will always look for the opportunities to do that. That's why you see kind of the changes in our content model from the
legacy linear model where there wasn't clear transparency to the consumer between the increase in the cost from the producer there to what they
were paying. What you see and what we're doing in the wireless space with content gives a lot more transparency there. So as costs go up, it's
much easier for those to flow through to the end user.

Operator

The next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

Two if I may. First, you're starting to talk more about -- as they disclosed more on fixed wireless, which we appreciate. But you've also talked about
the other 5G growth opportunity being mobile edge compute or MEC. When will we start to see that show up in the numbers and actually start
positively contributing to growth? And where -- what line items would you point to where we'll be able to see that?

And then secondly, Hans, you mentioned that next quarter, we should expect to see 2022 guidance. Just curious if your views on the metrics that
you're focusing on might change. You're going to be seeing incremental headwinds, particularly to EPS, tied to some accounting, I believe, on the
spectrum. Just curious if you believe guiding to EBITDA and/or free cash flow is something that might become more important when we see that
guidance for next year.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. Great question, Colby. First, on the mobile edge compute, we are -- first of all, we're doing great progress in mobile edge compute. And you
have seen that we have made announcements in the quarter with the biggest cloud providers in the market, both on the private 5G mobile edge
compute.

And as you remember, there are basically 3 use cases. One is the public mobile edge compute and then it's a private mobile age compute and then
it's private 5G networks. All of them sort of are in execution right now.

We're working with customers. We have announced a couple of commercial contracts already like Corning, the British Ports, et cetera. So that's
already happening. And of course, it takes some time because we are actually creating a totally new market, and we are actually alone in this market.
Nobody else in the world has launched mobile edge compute at this moment. So of course, we feel really good about that.

And the team is working through the funnel, all the way from proof of context to new applications. And that's how it works when you create new
markets, et cetera. So we will come back as soon as we feel it's time to start reporting it as we have done with 5G fixed wireless access.

But I'm even more sort of excited automobile edge compute, what I've seen in the last year here with the technology solutions we have and also
the customer interaction we have, together with the main partners. I mean, we have the biggest partners you can ever think about in this that are
equally much vested as us because that was part of the strategy to bring different partners together.

So we will continue with that, and we will come back and report. And we will give you new deals and how it is progressing with partners over time.
And ultimately, of course, it's going to be financials, and that's going to show up.

Initially, of course, it's going to be on Verizon Business Group that's going to have that as revenue. There is a B2B2C opportunity longer term, which
can end up in Consumer, but predominantly in the beginning is a Verizon Business Group opportunity.

Matt, on guidance, have you thought through what you're going to do next year? He hasn't told me yet.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

So Colby, great question. So obviously, we'll get into guidance at the next call. But as you mentioned, we always look at what year-over-year
pressures may be in there, especially things that are accounting-related rather than cash flow-related. We'll make sure we have the appropriate
level of transparency around that.

The important thing for us to be able to demonstrate in that guidance is how our strategy is working, and it's going to show up in revenue growth
and cash flow growth. And you see that this year, and we'll find a way to make sure that we could communicate clearly that we're continuing to
grow the top line of the business, and that's flowing through into the cash generation of the business as well, which is ultimately what it's all about.

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner

Two questions if I could, both sort of at the strategic level, Hans. First, maybe you could just update us on your expectations for what exactly do
you do differently when you get the TracFone asset? How do you think about the go-to-market strategy in the prepaid market in particular?

And then second, you've started to see some of the -- whether it's open signal or other reports suggesting that T-Mobile's network for 5G is faster
and broader coverage. How do you think about maintaining the sort of best network advantage that you've had? And what gives you confidence
that you can convey that in the business and consumer markets?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes, I can start with the second one. I mean, first of all, I mean, we rely on the RootMetrics because that's the most sophisticated and scientific way
of measuring the network. And it's -- we're undoubtedly the leader there. And without going into my competition because I never talk about them,
but clearly, one has always lost.

So if we then talk about the TracFone, which is, of course, an exciting opportunity for us, we're still to be closed. We're not -- we're going to have
the go-to-market and the brands that TracFone have. They are so good on prepaid, and they've shown that.

What we will, of course, support them with this all the back-end support all the way from supply chain, IT support, UX, customer care and all of
that. But clearly, we want to keep the point of sales. We want to keep the offerings, and we want to serve the value market. So that's where we are.
I cannot go further into that because we still have the pending sort of approval of it. But we will give you even more color, Craig, as soon as we
have closed this one.

Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst

So maybe a little bit of a longer-term question, Hans. When we look at your growth algorithm on the Consumer side, you have essentially an ARPU
and ARPA growth trend line as well as with revenue trend line, which is trailing in the (inaudible). They probably continue as you deploy C-Band.
And then (inaudible) increases, your G&A should also pick up as we head into next year. And then there is a competitive backdrop, which potentially
capture (inaudible). If you think about this growth algorithm, how do you keep margins intact when your revenue growth is essentially trailing?

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Kannan, you broke up there, but I think what you're trying to ask is how do we think about margin profile as ARPA trails the service revenue
growth. Matt, your thoughts?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

So we have tremendous opportunities, and you see it come through in the results we've delivered now for a few quarters of the ability to bring
high-quality customers in and then step them up. So the step-ups give us the increase in ARPA. And then the service revenue is, obviously, a
combination of the increase in revenue within the base and then also the impact of the new customers coming in.

So as you do that, we're very, very confident that you continue to add scale to our business, which is already the best in class from a scale standpoint.
And that will show up in the margin profile of the business going forward. So I expect us to continue to have a very strong margin profile going
forward.

It's built on executing the strategy. You see that in the results this year. You compare the Consumer margin in 3Q this year to 2 years ago, you see
that strategy is working and delivering results at both at the top line and the margin line.

Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst

Perfect. I have...

Your last question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.

Frank Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research

Can you give us a little more color? You mentioned there was a split in the fixed wireless between the Consumer and Business. How is that shaking
out? And then on the Business side, still a little bit weaker there. Is that just continued pricing pressure in the market? Or is it a share issue? Or walk
us through how you're looking at the enterprise space going forward.

OCTOBER 20, 2021 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q3 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. If I talk about the fixed wireless access on the Business side, it's called business Internet on that side, the offering we have. And of course, we
started off with our fixed wireless access on the Consumer side, and we later on added in our Business side to actually have access to it as well
because that's what -- how we wanted it to start.

I would say we have really good traction on the Business side on fixed wireless access, small and medium businesses, clearly, where we have our
stronghold and being the clear leader. So we see this as a great opportunity for our Verizon Business Group as well. And again, we are now adding
products and solutions for Verizon Business Group that over time should offset the wireline decline that we have, that Matt talked about.

When we talk about the Verizon Business Group, we haven't talked enough about them, but the momentum on wireless there is really good. I
mean, look at the small and medium businesses are coming back. They're doing a great job. On the enterprise side, the wireless business is doing
well as well.

The only area is a public sector is coming a little bit back. But that's a very natural thing because the sort of the increased demand of home education
and et cetera, during the COVID, of course, had a spike in wireless connections, which is just naturally coming down a little bit right now. But the
momentum on the wireless side on the Verizon Business Group and then you add the new opportunities, everything from application on top of
the network, the mobile edge compute, the fixed wireless access and over time, also opportunities outside the ILEC on Fios or at least on fiber.

So that's a great opportunity for us, and that's what we outlined already in 2019 when we decided to transform that business to see that we are
really well prepared for capturing those opportunities and those transformations that all the enterprise, small and medium companies will do to
digitalize over time. So I think we're in a good place. Simon and the team are doing a great job.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Frank. Now that's all the time we have today for questions. Thanks for joining the call, and everybody, be safe.

PRESENTATION 

Operator 

Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being 
recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. 

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Thanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. 

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. 
A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 

Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements 
about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may 
affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 

This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable 
GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. 

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.17 per share on a GAAP basis. 
Reported third quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $881 million. This includes a net pretax charge of 
approximately $645 million, primarily related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities and the impacts of amortization of intangible

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the third quarter.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Last quarter, we told you we would take actions. Today, I'm here to 
share the results those actions have delivered. 

We ended the third quarter with wireless service revenue growth up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. And adjusted EBITDA grew sequentially 
by almost 3% to $12.2 billion. We had total phone gross adds of nearly 2.6 million and about 5% year-over-year increase. This includes an increase 
in Consumer of 1.3%, a significant improvement from minus 11% in the second quarter. 

These results are early indicators that the actions we are taking across our businesses to build momentum are gaining traction. Of course, we're 
not done yet. I continue to work with my team to take actions to grow revenue and to take cost out of our business to unlock the full potential of 
Verizon. I'm glad to see sequential improvements based on our efforts, but there is more to do. Based on our momentum and plans, our financial 
guidance for 2022 remains unchanged. 

Throughout the call, you'll hear the actions we took and the impact they've had on our business to position Verizon for growth. Our pricing actions 
in the second quarter in both our Consumer and Business groups helped increase our wireless service revenue. Postpaid phone net adds came in 
8,000 for the quarter with a loss from Consumer offset by gains in Verizon Business. Matt will share more details with you later in the call. 

Let me turn to some of our group results. In Consumer, we have started to gain traction with customers reacting positively to our new offerings, 
and as a result, increased store traffic. Our Welcome plan improved customers' pricing perception and contributed to consumer phone gross adds 
being up year-over-year. 

With the launch of the iPhone 14, we delivered a first-of-its-kind Apple One Unlimited bundle. Verizon customers now have access to Apple services 
all under one subscription. Apple remains a unique and trusted partner of Verizon because they recognize our network quality and high-value 
customers. 

In the value segment, we launched Total By Verizon, redefining no contract wireless service, a key step in our continued integration of TracFone. 
And just this week, we introduced a prepaid wireless home Internet service on our Straight Talk brand. We continue to expand our offerings in the 
value segment, and customers are taking notice. This helped us generate positive prepaid net adds for the quarter, our first positive quarter since 
second quarter 2021. 

For postpaid, we're focused on attracting and retaining high-quality consumers in a disciplined and measured approach. As we see areas of 
opportunity, we will address them in a surgical manner just like we have done with some of our recent actions. There is more progress to make. 
Our premium strategy is working. 

We ended the third quarter with 53% of our customers having a 5G phone, and 81% of our base is on Unlimited plans. With a 42% uptake on 
premium unlimited, there's a great opportunity for step-ups. And we see that demand with approximately 60% of our new customers choosing 
Premium Unlimited right from the start. It is clear we have a high-quality customer base, so we will continue to focus on retention and winning 
these customers. 

Moving to Verizon Business. We see a continued very good momentum in both fixed wireless access and mobility. And I'm encouraged also by the 
large 5G infrastructure deals we made in the quarter. These include digital transformation projects with Astellas Pharmaceuticals, Fujifilm and our 
continued work with the Department of Defense.

In broadband, our fixed wireless access and Fios services continued to see strong demand. Total broadband net adds were 377,000, a sequential
growth of over 40%. All of these services are built to deliver on top of our world-class network. We have a premium network and experience that 
our customers value and that demands premium pricing. 

Our network is a core value proposition. America relies on us, and we deliver. This was evident before, during and in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Ian. Our team did what we always do: we ran to the crisis, quickly restoring our network as needed and using our technology solution to protect 
impacted areas. Bottom line, our network infrastructure was resilient, and our people delivered in the way that you have come to expect from us. 

Our mission has always been to build and operate the best, most reliable, highest-performing network. Our use of advanced technologies, our 
spectrum portfolio and our expansive own fiber footprint are critical to achieving that goal. Where we deploy our C-band, we see direct correlation 
to customer growth on both mobility and fixed wireless access. We are currently covering over 160 million POPs with C-band and on track to deliver 
200 million within the first quarter of 2023. 

C-band usage is up 170% quarter-over-quarter, and fixed wireless access now covers more than 40 million households. Right now, more than 48% 
of our cell sites are connected by Verizon owned fiber. We're expecting to be about 50% by year-end with the majority of our 5G sites already on 
our own fiber. This not only improves network performance but also improves our owners' economics. 

At the same time, we're making efforts to take cost out of our business. We're constantly thinking about how we run our enterprise every day to 
enhance our performance while delivering on our strategy. In this period, we have designed a company-wide cost-savings program that we expect 
will save between $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2025. A first step in these efforts is the creation of a global service organization under the 
leadership of Craig Silliman. This is one part of our larger program to leverage cross-functional opportunities across the business. 

Over the past 2 years, under unprecedented circumstances, we have learned a lot about how we deliver our services to customers. Verizon Global 
Services will help unlock significant efficiencies and reduce cost across the business. Keeping in line with our company values and strategy, we 
continue to practice financial discipline even in a competitive market and delivered solid financial performance quarter-over-quarter. 

Verizon is in a strong position, no matter economical environment with our high-quality customer base, diversified go-to-market options, including 
our value offering, the benefits from strengthening our organization through our cost-savings program and the best network that just keeps getting 
better. 

I will now hand it over to Matt to go deeper into our results. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Our results from the third quarter were not yet where we would like them to be. But as you heard 
from Hans, the actions we've taken in the past 2 quarters are gaining traction in the marketplace. As a result, we saw positive developments in 
store traffic and consumer phone gross adds, further gains in broadband and a sequential improvement in our financial results. We anticipate that 
we'll be able to build on this momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. 

Let's now walk through results from the third quarter, beginning with an overview of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our strategy for 
mobility growth is to drive revenue growth by attracting and retaining high-quality customers and migrating them into premium tiers. Premium 
penetration in the consumer segment increased to approximately 42% at quarter end, a sequential increase in line with prior quarters even with 
the introduction of the Welcome plan and the current economic backdrop.

With the impact of 3Q churn, which increased as expected as a result of our recent pricing actions, phone net adds were 8,000 for the quarter.

Business delivered 197,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter, their fifth consecutive quarter exceeding 150,000. The results were again 
balanced across the 3 customer groups with enterprise delivering their best-ever phone net add performance and SMB and public sector both 
seeing double-digit phone gross add growth. 

On the Consumer side, postpaid phone gross adds were up 1.3% year-over-year, a notable sequential improvement from an 11% decline in Q2. 
The launch of the Welcome plan and the Apple One Unlimited plan helped to generate more store traffic while providing another avenue to 
compete outside of promotional spend. We have now seen year-over-year improvement in phone gross add performance for 4 consecutive months 
through September and anticipate another low single-digit year-over-year growth performance in the fourth quarter. 

As expected, the pricing actions we took around administrative fees and metered plans led to an increase in disconnects. With certain price-ups 
being phased in throughout the third quarter, we would anticipate some disconnect pressure to carry over into Q4. Taken together, we currently 
expect the gross add and disconnect performance to result in positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter. 

Let's now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. Total broadband net adds were 377,000 in the quarter, reflecting a strong demand for reliable 
and high-value broadband offerings. Fixed wireless access momentum continued throughout the third quarter. We added 342,000 net adds, up 
from 256,000 in 2Q, reflecting increased demand across business and consumers. More than 75% of our consumer net adds are coming from urban 
and suburban locations with data usage that continues to mirror our Fios customers. We anticipate further share gains in this space as we continue 
to expand our household coverage and begin to realize benefits from our offering in the prepaid segment. 

We also added 61,000 Fios Internet net adds during the third quarter, reflecting improved gross add performance from Q2 as well as continued 
strong retention levels. Our ability to grow Fios in spite of some secular headwinds due to lower move activity shows that the quality, value and 
reliability that Fios offers continues to resonate strongly with customers. 

We further expanded our nationwide broadband opportunity by adding more fixed wireless households and businesses covered as well as growing 
our Fios open for sale within our ILEC footprint. Total fixed wireless household coverage surpassed 40 million in the quarter, including over 30 
million covered by 5G Ultra Wideband. Fios open for sale is now at 16.9 million, a year-to-date increase of 410,000, and we remain on track to hit 
our full year target of 550,000. 

Now let's talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our work to integrate TracFone continues, highlighted by the launch of our new prepaid brand, 
Total By Verizon, late in the quarter as well as the launch of fixed wireless for our prepaid customers earlier this month. For the quarter, we delivered 
positive prepaid net adds of 39,000, which excludes a base adjustment of 102,000 primarily relating to a competitor's 3G network shutdown. We 
saw significant improvement in TracFone's performance, which had positive net adds for the first time since Q1 2021. 

With our current momentum, combined with the launch of our new brand and fixed wireless, we're excited about our positioning and ability to 
further grow in the value market, bringing more connectivity and benefits to customers in this space. 

Now let's move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was up 4.0% year-over-year as wireless 
service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue more than offset wireline declines and the net impact of last year's M&A activity. 
As a reminder, the third quarter last year only had 2 months of Verizon Media activity before its divestiture. 

Total wireless service revenue growth was up 10.0% from the prior year, primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, continued effectiveness 
of our premium Unlimited strategy and business volumes. The core business is strong as wireless service revenue, excluding all TracFone activities, 
grew above 3%.

We continue to feel the pressures of higher device subsidies and promotional spending despite taking steps throughout Q3 to be disciplined,
We continue to feel the pressures of higher device subsidies and promotional spending despite taking steps throughout Q3 to be disciplined,
including the launch of the Welcome plan, which comes without a device subsidy. Inflationary pressures remain elevated both from a year-over-year 
and sequential point of view with the increase from Q2 primarily coming from higher electricity rates. Expectations for full year 2022 impacts of 
inflation remain consistent with comments during our Q2 earnings call. 

To further mitigate inflation impacts, we have started a new cost-savings program that we expect will provide a reduction in annual cost of $2 
billion to $3 billion by 2025. This program will be focused on several areas within the business, including digitalization efforts to enhance the 
customer experience and streamlining internal operations through automation and process enhancements. While part of this will benefit the 
bottom line, a portion of these savings will be reinvested into the business to help accelerate opportunities. 

As Brady noted, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.32. In addition to the impact from EBITDA, this reflects sequential pressures in interest 
expense due to rate increases and a reduction in other income associated with noncash changes to pension and OPEB. 

Based on year-to-date interest rate increases and market expectations for additional Federal Reserve actions this year, we now estimate cash interest 
expense for 2022 to be about $400 million higher than our expectation coming into the year. We anticipate this pressure will continue into next 
year given the full year impact from interest rate increases, providing an EPS headwind in 2023. Likewise, the impact from noncash pension costs 
due to higher interest rates and lower return on assets this year is expected to put additional pressure on below-the-line items for 2023. 

Now let's take a look at our third quarter Consumer financial results. Total Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.8% year-over-year driven by 
wireless service revenue growth of 11.0% as well as higher equipment revenue. Wireless service revenue increases were the result of the inclusion 
of TracFone, core wireless service revenue growth and the impact of the pricing actions. 

Total Fios revenue was up versus the same period a year ago by 0.3% as growth from our Internet base offset the revenue impact of a 9% year-over-year 
decline in video subscribers. Fios content costs have also dropped, resulting in an improved margin profile that we expect will continue to benefit 
from further shifts away from video. 

Consumer EBITDA was $10.6 billion, up 0.7% compared to the same period last year. The pricing actions as well as the full inclusion of TracFone 
results more than offset the pressures from higher promotional activity and the impact of inflation. 

Next, let's take a closer look at the Business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment's wireless results remained strong in 3Q, though 
wireline service revenue declines continued due to ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 5.7% was up from 3.0% last 
quarter, aided by pricing actions as well as continued growth in our customer base. Wireline revenue declined by 6.7% versus prior year. Operating 
trends are consistent with prior quarters though in Q3, we saw a sequential increase in USF revenue due to higher rates. Business EBITDA was $1.8 
billion for the quarter, down 6.7% from the prior year. In addition to pressure from wireline, we experienced higher growth-related costs as wireless 
sales volumes were up by 15% from the prior year. 

Now let's move on to Slide 13 and the cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 3 quarters of 2022 totaled $28.2 billion 
compared with $31.2 billion in the prior year period as working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased inventory levels 
continue, as we expected. Capital spending for the first 3 quarters of the year totaled $15.8 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to last year. 

C-band spending was $4.5 billion for the first 9 months of the year. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash 
flow of $12.4 billion for the first 3 quarters of the year. We exited the quarter with $129.3 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement 
of $1.3 billion, resulting in a net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x.

Thank you, Matt. The actions we have taken are showing progress, but there's more work to be done. Our priorities through the end of the year 
and into 2023 are straightforward: continue our traction in Consumer wireless through the holiday season and into 2023; maintain and grow our 
momentum in fixed wireless access and Business wireless; implement the initial framework of a cross-functional efficiency program and improve 
our working capital efficiencies; and finally, continue our measured and strategic approach to the market with financial discipline and increased 
momentum for the quarters to come. 

While there's work to be done, I'm confident that we are well-positioned to deliver. So thank you. Now we're ready for your questions. Brady, back 
to you. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions. 

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

Operator 

(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. 

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst 

Two quick ones, if I can. First, I know you guys don't -- you often hold off on giving guidance until the fourth quarter call, but it sounds like you got 
a number of sort of below-the-line headwinds to growth next year. But what's the prognosis for EBITDA growth in '23 given all the moving parts 
and all the cost savings you have coming through? 

And then secondly, on postpaid phone churn, it ticked up. And just looking for clarifications on Matt's comments that it's going to stay elevated. 
How do you expect that to progress as we move through '23? And what do you think is really driving? It sounds like you obviously -- you had the 
price increase. But just fundamentally, are the prices at Verizon just too high at this point given what we're seeing from a macro environment and 
given the -- something approaching network parity that we have in the market today?

Thank you, John. I can start and Matt will fill in. I mean when it comes to the quarter and the gross adds and the churn, I think what happened is

that we came out from the second quarter where the soft quarter on the Consumer side when it comes to gross adds. We added a couple of new
products all the way from the Welcome plan to the price adjustments. And of course, the outcome we were expecting was that we continue to
products all the way from the Welcome plan to the price adjustments. And of course, the outcome we were expecting was that we continue to
grow both ARPA but also our wireless service revenue. And as you heard, we grew the service revenue with 3.5% if we exclude TracFone, but then
grow both ARPA but also our wireless service revenue. And as you heard, we grew the service revenue with 3.5% if we exclude TracFone, but then
with TracFone. So that clearly is working for us, and we will continue to do that.

But we will do it in certain segments where we see weakness. I mean we also saw a very strong continuation in our premium segments, where we 
continue to have now more than 81% of consumers on unlimited and 42% on Unlimited Premium. So we -- that area is going well. So we just need 
to find those areas, and we will continue to do that. But I think that we have a very competitive pricing in the market. 

We add that with values like the One plan with Apple right now, Apple One Unlimited, et cetera, and we have more to come. So it's -- for us it's a 
grind it to see that we do the right in the segment. And of course, we have the largest consumer base in the market. So we just need to see that 
we're doing this in the right way. And ultimately, our goal is to continue to grow our EBITDA. And you saw this quarter, we grew our EBITDA with 
almost 3%. And that's what we're doing, and we keep our guidance for the full year. 

So we -- that's our job. And then on top of that, we take out costs. So I think all in all, that's what we're working with constantly here. And it's a big 
ship we're moving. I think that this quarter, we saw all the actions we took in the second quarter having impact -- positive impact. That doesn't 
mean we're done. We think we can do more and we have more to do. So that's sort of the summary of where I think we are and how we're executing, 
and then we'll continue to execute this in this quarter and the quarters to come. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. Thanks, Hans. And John, so maybe the second part of your question first around churn and is our pricing in the right place. I'd point you to the 
fact that our gross adds were up almost 5% on a year-over-year basis in 3Q. So obviously, our offerings continue to resonate with customers, 
obviously, built on having the best network, and consumers continue to see the value of that. So continue to believe that the gross add traffic will 
be there, and we'll get our fair share. 

On the churn side, just to put it in perspective, the pricing actions we took across both the metered plans and the fees touch more than 75 million 
phone customers. And so the uptick in churn that we saw in the quarter was highly expected. We kind of mentioned that 90 days ago that we 
expected it to happen. But the financial benefits came through as well, which was exactly as we expected and was the right approach to take. 

So obviously, the impact of those changes will mitigate as we go forward here, and we'll continue to make sure that our churn is where it needs to 
be to ensure the right results. In terms of the first part of your question, you're right, we'll speak to you more specifically about 2023 on the next 
call. We're obviously in the middle of our planning cycle right now. But you should certainly expect us to build on the momentum that you saw us 
deliver in the third quarter. 

You saw that wireless service revenue up sequentially 2%. As Hans mentioned, EBITDA up sequentially about 3%. That gives us a good platform 
to build on here in 4Q and then as we head into '23. And then you mentioned below-the-line, there will be some pressures next year. I'm not going 
to quantify those now. But as you think about the specifics of those, some of those we've spoken to all of you about before. When we came out of 
the C-band auction. We said that we would expect depreciation to increase and capitalized interest to reduce as we've deployed C-band sites and 
put them on there, and really having kind of significant year-over-year impacts in '23 and '24. So that's in line with what we've been talking about 
for a while. 

And then you layer on top of that, obviously, interest rates are higher, and we'll have a full year impact of that next year. And that impacts both the 
interest expense line, but also other noncash below-the-line items around pension and OPEB, where the imputed interest cost will be higher with 
the higher macro rates and then also starting the year with lower assets because of the performance this year.

The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. 

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst 

It's about your sort of emerging nationwide broadband strategy. So I think you mentioned that you can now offer the fixed wireless product to 
over 40 million potential customers. I think from your Analyst Day last year, the ultimate target is 64 million with 50 million of that being residential 
and the rest being business. 

You're also -- and you made a point about this, you're deploying a lot of fiber, primarily just to put your mobile network on a national basis. And 
so the real question is, now that you have seen the fixed wireless product perform and what it does on the network side of things, how are you 
thinking about that target of eventually reaching 64 million homes? You think it could potentially be greater? 

And then yesterday, AT&T talked about evaluating opportunities to do more of a fiber-to-the-home strategy out of region. I imagine leveraging 
some of the fiber they're deploying in their wireless network. Considering how expansive your national fiber footprint is becoming, is that something 
you're evaluating as well? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you, Brett. When it comes to our national broadband strategy, first of all, I think it's working really good for us. You saw in the quarter adding 
377,000. The Fios footprint continue to be extremely high-quality customers and continue to grow. We will continue to expand that footprint. 

Outside that, we, of course, have a very high focus on fixed wireless access because the speed to market, because the demand in the market right 
now is high for broadband. And of course, we have a very disruptive model where it takes low single digits minutes to actually get broadband at 
home. It's a total different product when it comes to fixed wireless access. So we capture the market as soon as we can right now, and you see on 
our growth rates that is happening both for Consumer as for Business. 

But as you rightfully said, we are deploying the network as we speak, and we are just into certain markets given on the C-band, we will have more 
and more markets. And as we stated in the remarks, I mean, we are now covering 40 million households with our fixed wireless access. So we will 
continue to expand that, and we have plans and execution. It's working well. The quality is improving. The customer satisfaction is really high on 
fixed wireless access. And of course, there are the competition in these areas are, of course, not equally good customer satisfaction. 

So no, I think -- we think -- we are confident that this is a good strategy for us. Then when it comes to our fiber, you're absolutely right. We have 
done enormous investment in fiber. We want owners' economics on our network, and we are getting that because with the majority of all the 5G 
sites have our own fiber, and we're now passing 50% by year-end on all our sites. 

Some sites will never need fiber. So it's not like 100% is the end goal. But in order to have a good experience for our customers, that's what we're 
doing. Then we want to see opportunities, especially for the Business side to use that fiber footprint outside. I'd like to see that some customers 
can get a better or we can substitute third-party fiber that we are getting from others. But clearly, focus on fiber in the Fios footprint, fixed wireless 
access going as fast as we can outside that. 

So yes, we are confident about the strategy and it's working. We have talked about for several years. We come out with new products that's going 
to be multi-spectrum. That's going to handle everything from 4G, C-band, millimeter wave. So the resilience and the performance and quality of 
the products is even getting better. So yes, that's where we are. Matt?

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. 

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD 

Matt, a quick one for you. Any changes to the 2023 CapEx guidance you gave out for that significant drop from this year? And then more broadly, 
back in March, you talked about a clear path to 4%-plus revenue growth in 2024 and beyond. Could you maybe update us on how that looks, how 
the kind of things like mobile edge compute, B2B applications are scaling? And what you can do to get there and give us more visibility around 
that. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Yes. I can start on the enterprise side with the mobile edge compute, which we -- and the private 5G networks. As I said a couple of times before 
-- right now, we had 3 different sort of use cases on the edge computing: one was private networks, another was public mobile edge compute, 
and the third was the private 5G mobile edge compute. We see clearly a very strong demand on the private 5G networks, which is the prelude to 
go into all others, and the funnel is strong. And we talked about a couple of examples this quarter, which we have gained. 

And it's a normal typical enterprise or B2B cycle, where you start with one proof of concept, then you start deploying it, and then you roll it out. So 
that's going to continue to happen over the years is, of course, not going to be any significant revenues in the short term. But over time, we're 
building a totally new opportunity for Sampath and his team to be with customers in larger sort of turnkey projects to reform and transform their 
digital asset for enterprises. 

So we are still really confident this is a good strategy for us. And it's -- again, we're building on the same network. We built a network once, and we 
have several different use cases where the mobility and now the fixed wireless access, both are going in a high speed. And now we're adding the 
mobile edge compute that's starting to get off to a good start, especially with private 5G networks. And then we move into mobile edge compute. 
So that's how I see that market continue for us. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. Simon, so your first question around CapEx. Obviously, we'll be more specific on '23 guidance in January, but nothing has changed around 
our view of CapEx. So very much in line. And that's because of the great work the team has done this year. I mean we said we'd be at 175 million 
POPs covered by the end of the year. As you heard Hans say earlier, already at more than 160 million through 3Q. Not only will we be ahead of the 
175 million, but we'll be at 200 million at some point during the first quarter. So phenomenal speed that the team has built the network there. 

That means a significant chunk of the $10 billion CapEx for C-band will have been covered between last year and this year. So it will just be a small 
stub piece of that left next year, and then we'll be at those BAU levels that we've spoken to all of you about numerous times.

where we see things as well. But certainly continuing to build on the momentum that we've seen in the last quarter.

The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. 

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst 

First, a follow-up, please, on John's question. You're still losing accounts in Consumer despite pushing pretty hard this quarter. What did you see 
an impact from the introduction Unlimited plan? And how did that contribute to your gross adds improvement this quarter? 

And then second, can you give us any idea of what's going on in Business? You're seeing really strong adds. AT&T as well and T-Mobile is saying 
the same thing. Is this second lines being bought by businesses for their employees? What type of usage do you see in those lines? Just give us an 
idea of what's going on in the industry. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

I can start on the Business side. We have seen strong business growth on the wireless side for 5 consecutive quarters. So clearly, what we see is 
that both from the government, from large enterprises, small and medium businesses, they rely on the -- on high-performing networks is extremely 
important, and that's what we're giving them. And that's why we are growing. 

I mean we have had a really good run on it, and the team is doing a great job. I mean this quarter was 197,000 net -- phone net adds in the Business 
segment. And as Matt said, it's across over all the 3 segments: government, enterprise and small and medium businesses. So clearly, we have a 
good transformation there with our customers. And of course, adding to that, we have a great sales force out there every day with all these accounts 
because it's about the network, and it's about the go to market. And we are the strongest in both, so we feel really good about that. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. And just building on that maybe a little bit... 

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst 

I'm sorry, Hans, if I can just...

idea of what's driving this strength. And it's not just you, it's across the board.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Okay. No, it's the same -- it's normal. We see more, of course, as any company will go in more mobile. It's not like we're seeing secondary lines or 
something like that. And remember, we -- if it's sort of an IoT line, et cetera, that's outside this. We're talking about phone net adds here. So this is 
normal lines that is coming into our customers for normal usage. We haven't seen any difference in that compared to previous quarter that is 
something strange there. No, it's actually normal lines coming in that customers are transforming more to mobility. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. And Phil, just maybe building on that a little bit. Certainly, the continued strong employment position feeds into this. That's very much 
supported. But look, I think the other thing as you think about Business to think about is the depth of the relationships we have with Business 
customers over many years from both wireless and our legacy wireline relationships. And the quality of the network continues to matter to our 
Business customers, and our team have been very effective at selling into those customers. 

But if you're -- if the suggestion from anything that you've been hearing is these are secondary lines with low usage on it, that couldn't be more 
further from the truth. These are absolutely primary lines. We see it in the usage. Certainly, as businesses continue and more and more people are 
mobile, and we see that. But these are absolutely primary use lines, and we know that from the usage we see on there. 

In terms of on the Consumer side, on accounts, certainly, that trend is something that continued into 3Q. And -- but you also saw the positive 
momentum from a gross add standpoint, and that feeds through into the account trend also moving in a better line than it was. And as we said in 
the prepared remarks, we expect 4Q to have positive phone net adds, and that should show up in the trend on the account side as well. 

So look, overall gross adds are up 5%, and they were up on a year-over-year base in Consumer. So there's a lot of good things going on. And then 
within our base, we just have to keep reminding people of the value. The team is doing an outstanding job there, and they've got more to bring 
to the market here as we go forward. 

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst 

Any idea of what the contribution from Welcome and Unlimited was not? 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. It's mix. You've got to think about the contribution from Welcome in 2 ways: one, obviously, in terms of the number of adds that people signed 
up for; but more importantly, the number of additional visits to the stores that it drove. Because certainly, some people who came in to Welcome, 
but it also gave us the opportunity to talk to more customers coming into the stores about all of our plans. 

So we'd have a good number of customers that came in because they had seen the Welcome pricing, but then actually purchased one of our Mix 
& Match price plans as well. So we don't really have a specific breakout there for you, but definitely a contributor to the increase in store traffic and 
the increase in gross adds.

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.
The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD
David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

I guess 2, if I could. I'd like to ask a corollary to Phil's question there, which is -- obviously, we had like negative 11% gross adds last quarter, positive 
1% in Consumer this quarter. Where are those gross adds coming from? I think you highlighted that you felt there was a hole in the portfolio with 
respect to BYOD. I would suggest that the BYOD concentrated players, maybe the cable players, are maybe ones that are giving you market share 
or maybe you've seen something else in the porting ratios that have changed the game. I'd be interested in where you think this SOGA shift is 
coming from? 

And then the second piece, Matt, your exposure on the balance sheet to variable rates -- rising rates is not because you have floating rate debt per 
se but because you took actions in terms of swaps and hedges to create that variable rate exposure. Theoretically, you could buy your way out of 
that if you felt that was an economic way to go. Arguably, you could maybe take those losses through to your adjusted EPS, and then it could affect 
your earnings per share trajectory. Is there any part of you that thinks that there's an economic opportunity that might present itself to reverse 
gear in some of that variable rate exposure? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Thank you. A couple of things, what drove the gross adds. I mean, first of all, I think, as Matt said, the Welcome plan drove -- because that was a 
segment we were softer in the first and the second quarter, and that's why we addressed it. And that was probably the quickest turnaround we 
have done ever to bring out a new plan dedicated and nationwide. And that should be a reflection of how we plan to work. 

I mean we will be very agile. We will quickly move into segments where we see softness in our consumer base. And I'm happy with what I've seen 
so far. But also the marketing work because if you think about the growth we had both in gross adds, but also, as Matt said, when it comes to store 
visits, that was up more than double digit in the quarter compared to second quarter. So all that together work, and that's what we need to continue 
to work and see if there are other weaknesses in the Consumer portfolio. 

Remember now, we're going all the way from the premium down to the lowest and most cost-efficient plans on our prepaid. And the work we're 
doing, we have integrated that in our Consumer group right now. And we're look into that we're doing the right things for every segment and see 
that we have the right offerings for our customers. That might be that we're aggressive in certain segments and not in others. 

And that's sort of where we come with our size right now, we can do that. And I was happy with seeing what happened in the second quarter -- or 
in the third quarter with some of the actions we've taken. But we're not finished yet. We need to do more of this. We need to be more surgical. We 
need to attack the areas where we see weakness. But that was what's growing the gross adds in the quarter, clearly. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. On the question around interest rates. So we've absolutely had a targeted rate of effective variable to fixed, and that served us very well, 
continues to serve us very well over the course of the economic cycle. And we think that creates value over the course of the cycle for the company, 
and obviously, shareholders as well. 

As you mentioned, Dave, obviously, this year has seen significant increase there. And so some of those hedges have obviously moved around in 
value. I couldn't be happier with the work the treasury team has done, not just this year but over many years now to not just manage the overall 
debt profile but also the interest rate expense. You see that in the income statement over the past few years, where even as our debt has gone up 
to pay for the C-band acquisition and so on, our total interest expense cost has actually remained relatively flat.

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. 

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst 

When you look across the strategic products, postpaid phones for Consumer and Business and Fios broadband, what's the risk that customers 
trade-down in rate plan tiers, if the U.S. goes into recession? 

And then pivoting over to the value segment, has Verizon begun to migrate any prepaid customers to the postpaid base? And can you size the 
future opportunity and timing for this possible migration? And then just one more, if I could, on prepaid. Is there an update on the size and timing 
of savings, especially for roaming when you think about the TracFone integration? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Okay. Let me start with the first one. As we said earlier, the Welcome plan worked very well for us, and we didn't see many of our customers trading 
down. Actually, it was more about softness in the marketplace there, and that's where we actually gained success. And then -- but on the other 
hand, we saw many of our customers coming into the store. And then we -- after a conversation, of course, we saw them actually doing a step-up 
and then going for another plan. 

So it actually worked. We didn't see that step-down in the market has happened so far, where I think we're segmenting it up with the values we 
have in each and every segment. So -- but if they would do it over time, given the economic situation, we will be better prepared than anybody 
else. And when we are actually addressing all the segments of the market, so we can work with that. 

When it comes to the prepaid -- to the postpaid migration, that is, of course, one of the pillars in our strategy to see that our customers can do that 
and part of our acquisition strategy to see that we can offer the customers. That will take some IT work. And as I said before, that will technically, 
meaning that you can now more easily work in between prepaid and postpaid. That will take some time before it's finished. 

But already today, of course, we have a collaboration in between our groups as this is sort of under one roof, the whole value and premium segments. 
So I think that's what we're going to do. But that's, of course, an opportunity for us over time to have more of that. But already right now, we're 
seeing good sign on our value segment as we start growing in the third quarter. 

And we just added new products, including Total wireless, which is a higher end of the value market as well as adding now fixed wireless access 
to the -- to some of the brands. So there is much more to do. And we're encouraged what we have seen so far about the potential, and that was 
the reason we acquired TracFone, because we saw this potential to play in all the Consumer segment and adding products in different ways and 
scaling sort of our platforms. The more we can scale the platforms, the network and the products, the more efficient we're going to be on the return 
on capital invested. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. A couple of follow-ups there, Mike. So the risk of trading down, we've obviously seen a number of different economic cycles during the life of 
the wireless business. And we don't historically see significant amounts of trade-down during a macro downturn. So I don't expect anything 
different, again, because the value that people place on their connectivity products, whether that's broadband or wireless, is higher than ever. So 
we'll obviously monitor it closely, but history would suggest the risk of that is not that high.

The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. 

Tim Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst 

So C-band build-outs going faster and it sounds like better than expected. So Matt, can you talk about when you think you'll largely be done with 
that spending and maybe just the ultimate -- thinking on the ultimate POPs covered and capacity that you're adding? Any color there would be 
great. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Yes. I can start, and Matt will come in there as well. But when it comes to the C-band spending, you remember, we said we're going to do an 
additional $10 billion on CapEx. The year has not ended, but you have seen more or less where we are guiding. So it's going to be some portion 
left for the next year on CapEx, but that's a smaller part. And then it's going to be BAU because then we have done all our initial. 

What is happening after that is, of course, we're getting a much more spectrum to the sites and we get some more markets. But then we're down 
to BAU as we have always been building capacity and network on 4G, 3G. Now we'll do it on 5G with the spectrum we have. So feel good about 
that situation and how we have been doing it. And this was part of the strategy we laid out for the network already 2017, in order to draw the 
benefit of a unified network with a strong sort of edge capability with different type of access technologies. 

And now, of course, with C-band, we're adding that strength. So we're going to pass the 200 million POPs in the first quarter 2023, and then we 
will just continue to deploy as we're getting more spectrum. I mean still today, we're using mainly 60 megahertz. There are some places where 
we've started to trial out 100 megahertz. But as you know, we have 161 megahertz nationwide. And in some places, we're 200 megahertz. So we 
have so much more spectrum and capacity. But the guys have been building smart. So when the spectrum comes, we turn it up. It's not going out 
to the site again. So we are ready for that. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. So Tim, just on the -- exactly what Hans said on the timing. If you think about it, we're still spending on the LTE network today, and that's 
obviously 10-plus years from when we launched. So that's because the usage on the network continues to grow, the utility people get from it 
continues to grow. And that's why you see our customer base expanding as a result. 

But as you think about connecting the dots here, as we said, we'll be close to 200 million -- well, we'll cross 200 million POPs in the first quarter of 
next year. The $10 billion will largely be spent -- we said there'd be a stub left over to next year, so that kind of overlaps there. So think about it 
from the standpoint, the $10 billion took care of covering the first roughly 200 million POPs. 

Then the rest of it goes into BAU. And you create space in BAU because those 200 million POPs have now got C-band coverage. We said over half 
of our base has a 5G compatible device in their hands. And so the usage growth in those areas is going on C-band. That means we don't have to 
continue spending on LTE in those markets. 

And then combined with other programs that are coming to an end on the peak spend, such as One Fiber, Intelligent Edge Network, that's the 
space for the C-band continued build, both from a coverage and a capacity standpoint, to be in the BAU-level spend, just like as we continue to

Tim Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst 

So any updates on the ultimate amount of coverage that you'll have or POPs covered and rough timing on that? 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

I think Kyle has said pretty clearly that you should expect -- where you get 4G today, you should be expecting to get 5G in the future as we continue 
to build out. 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Yes. Our C-band spectrum is nationwide, every market, every state. So we're just going to complete that and see that we have a similar as the 4G 
network, as Matt says. 

Operator 

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. 

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst 

Hans, I wonder if you could talk about convergence a little bit, particularly on the Consumer side of your business. There's certainly a broad sense 
that the industry is moving towards converged offerings of wireless and home Internet. How do you think about that? And how do you think about 
it differently in areas where you have Fios and where you have fixed wireless broadband? Is that, in some ways, what's driving the fixed wireless 
broadband deployment? Or do you see them as still somewhat 2 separate services that are trying to fill 2 separate needs? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

Craig, I think, first of all, we have seen some early steps of convergence in a market where mobility and home is going together. Of course, ultimately, 
the customers will define, is that the best model. I think we're in a great position for obvious reasons, where we deploy our fixed -- remember, when 
we deploy our network on the C-band, we start in urban and suburban. And that's, of course, also where the fixed wireless access opportunity 
arises. 

So then the combination of fixed and home and mobile is emerging there. So we're going to play on that. And as you have seen we have offerings 
on that in the market and also working with our Fios footprint equally much. We have the optionality. And the customers will decide if that is a 
good way forward. I think we are in a very strong position. We have owners' economics on all our home broadband and all our mobility and being 
able to see that we can follow the market. 

And it goes back a little bit to what I said before. We need to be agile and be surgical in different segments. If we see that, for example, convergence 
is happening in certain segments, we quickly come out with offerings and do that. And that's what the team is working with constantly right now.

Your last question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. 

Frank Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research 

What are the largest factors impacting your churn in your base right now? And kind of after we get through this bump from the pricing action, 
what do you need to address to get the churn back down? And how soon can we see those tactics begin to work? 

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO 

I think when it comes to the consumer churn, as Matt explained, the vast majority in the third quarter was coming from the price adjustments we 
did, which was a deliberate decision we took in the second quarter, and it was as expected. That was the larger piece of it in the churn. 

And as Matt said before, our job right now is to continue to drive this downwards and see that, that is evaporating out there. We have some leakage 
into the -- into October from it because -- given how the price adjustments come out in the market. 

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO 

Yes. Just, Frank, to build on that a little bit. So absolutely, we expected to see that increase, but it was certainly a good a good trade for us because 
it drove the gross add increase that we spoke about earlier, also drove a 2% sequential increase in service revenue and 3% in EBITDA. So we'll work 
through the bubble from that as we go forward. But obviously, the actions produce the type of results that we wanted. 

We'll expect to get back to more normal levels going forward. We constantly have to communicate to our base of customers, the value of being 
on the Verizon network, and that's something that we've got many years of doing. As we just spoke about a couple of questions ago, the quality 
of that network with the C-band build-out is expanding rapidly. And we have the opportunity to continue to demonstrate to customers the premium 
service they get on Verizon. 

And as we do that, I'm very confident that churn will get back to the levels we'd expect it to be. And combined with the improved gross add 
performance, we'll see that show up in the financials, and more importantly, in strong cash flow from the business. So really happy with the 
sequential trajectory we have. We need to keep building on that as we go forward here. That's what the team is focused on. 

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR 

Brad, that's all the time we have today.

PRESENTATION

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the Verizon fourth-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being
recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP, IR

Thanks, Tori. Good morning and welcome to our fourth-quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I am here with our Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides, including a supplemental information slide,
are available on the investor relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.

Before we get started I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains
statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risk and uncertainties. Discussion of factors
that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.

This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website.

The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted
as sequential.

Before Matt goes through our results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $1.10 per share
and full-year earnings of $3.21 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I would like to highlight.

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Our reported fourth-quarter earnings include a non-cash, pretax gain of about $1.6 billion. The largest item was the mark-to-market adjustment
of our pension and OPEB liabilities, which was a pretax gain of roughly $1.8 billion. This adjustment, which was primarily non-cash, was caused by
an increase in the discount rate as well as other planned factors.

We also incurred pretax expenses of nearly $200 million, primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. The net impact
of these items after tax approximated $1 billion, or $0.24 per share.

Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share were $0.86 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.89 a year ago, a
decline of 3.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $3.87 compared with $3.99 in 2015, a decrease of 3%. Recall that our 2015
adjusted EPS included $0.13 of depreciation benefit related to the three Wireline properties that we sold to Frontier.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call and thank you for joining us today. I look forward to working with our investors and all of you
who follow our stock in sharing progress on our strategy to deliver the promise of the digital world.

We are in a vibrant and exciting industry. Our leadership position in wireless and fiber networks, as well as our loyal and high-quality customer
base, is a reflection of our commitment to continuous improvement by our outstanding employees, which places us in a great position for long-term
profitable growth. The continuous changes from technology advances and the competitive environment will provide us new opportunities to
evolve and develop innovative solutions to continue to be a key player in this dynamic market.

I am energized by those challenges and the great team we have and I am excited about the coming years. My primary objective is to build on the
strong foundation of this business and ensure we are always being responsible stewards of the Company by running the business as we have today
as efficiently and effectively as possible, while investing responsibly to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value.

Let's now move into an overview of 2016.

As expected, 2016 was a transformative year for Verizon. We demonstrated strong financial performance and returned value to our shareholders
while repositioning the business. Our core businesses are executing well in highly competitive markets and we are on track with our strategic
priorities.

During 2016 we completed Wireline divestitures of three markets, negotiated new contracts with our labor unions, executed successful 5G technical
trials, and gained traction in new growth businesses. Operationally, in Wireless, with our network leadership strategy, we added 1.3 million
smartphone net adds and maintained industry-leading retail phone churn performance of less than 0.9% for the year after seven consecutive
quarters.

In Wireline, we restructured the segment and its cost structure. Overall, we delivered solid operational and financial results, which I will go into
more detail in a few minutes.

Our capital allocation was consistent with our strategy. We invested in adding capacity through densification of the 4G network, acquired telematics
and smart city businesses, and extended ecosystems to monetize data traffic. We reduced our unsecured debt and delivered strong value to our
shareholders through the 10th consecutive increase in annualized dividends last September.

Entering 2017 we are confident with our strategy and priorities to serve customers and increase value. The foundation of our strategy is a network
that is ubiquitous and reliable. We will continue to invest in our networks, expand network capabilities, and advance ecosystems to offer value to
our customers.

The execution of these priorities will allow us to lead at the network layer and develop innovative solutions to meet customer demands in the
rapidly expanding mobile-first digital world.

Now let's get right into the operating performance, starting with our consolidated results on slide 6.

Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $32.3 billion, a decline of 5.6%. Consolidated 2016 revenue was $126.0 billion, representing a
decline of 4.3%. If we exclude revenues from the divested Wireline properties and AOL, which became part of our operations during the second
half of 2015, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 2.4%.

Wireless revenue tracked with our expectations in the quarter as the shift from service revenue to equipment revenue across our base of customers
is ongoing. Equipment revenue was seasonally strong, primarily led by new smartphone launches and equipment installment take rates. Wireline
segment revenues continued recent trends, declining 3.1% with consumer growth of 0.2% for the quarter.

In our new businesses we are pleased with AOL's performance for the quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, our digital media business, led
by AOL, generated revenue of $532 million net of traffic acquisition costs. This revenue is down about 5% year over year as expected, due to the
revenue lift related to the Microsoft deal in the fourth quarter of 2015, but increased around 10% sequentially, in line with expectations.

Organically, Internet of Things revenue was $243 million, up 21% in the fourth quarter. We expect to sustain these strong trends. Including
acquisitions, Internet of Things revenue increased more than 60% in the fourth quarter.

Strong cost management across the business enabled us to drive profitability, including offsetting the lost earnings contribution from the divested
Wireline markets. On a consolidated full-year basis, excluding nonoperational items, EBITDA totaled $44.8 billion and EBITDA margin was 35.5%.

Now let's turn to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 7.

In 2016, cash flows from operations totaled $22.7 billion, which is impacted by payments of cash income taxes of $3.2 billion associated with the
gain on the divested wireline properties. Full-year capital spending of $17.1 billion was just below our guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.
Free cash flow for the year totaled $5.7 billion, which does not include the proceeds from on-balance-sheet securitization transactions.

In the second half of 2016, we shifted to on-balance-sheet securitization of our equipment receivables as it provides us a lower overall cost of
funding. As we have previously noted, the proceeds from our on-balance-sheet securitization program are reflected in the cash flows and financing.
During the fourth quarter, we generated cash proceeds of about $2.4 billion from on-balance-sheet securitization, for a total of $5.0 billion during
the second half of the year.

Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $108.1 billion of gross debt,
which comprised of $103.1 billion of unsecured debt and $5 billion of on-balance-sheet securitizations. Our year-end unsecured debt balance was
lower by $6.6 billion from the prior year. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit-rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.

Now let's move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on slide 8.

In the Wireless business, we are delivering a balanced operational performance in a highly-competitive environment. Total Wireless operating
revenue declined 1.5% in the quarter to $23.4 billion. For the full year, operating revenue totaled $89.2 billion, a decline of 2.7%.

Service revenue of $16.3 billion declined 4.9% for the quarter as compared to the 5.2% decline in the third quarter. For the full year, service revenue
declined 5.4%.

Overall, service revenue trends are consistent with the postpaid base migrations to unsubsidized service pricing. Approximately 67% of our postpaid
customers are now on unsubsidized pricing, which is ahead of our expectations, due to higher volumes in the fourth quarter.

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Service revenue plus device payment plan billings increased 1.7% in the fourth quarter and 2.0% for the full year. This deceleration in trend is due
to the strong migration of customers in the second half of the year to unsubsidized pricing as customers fulfilled their prior service contracts.

We are also seeing strong migrations to our new pricing structure that we launched midyear with safety mode and carryover data. While these
plans have resulted in greater-than-expected optimization, they improved customer satisfaction and retention. Recently we launched a single-line
pricing plan to improve our competitive position in that segment.

Equipment revenue increased to $5.7 billion, up 6.2% for the fourth quarter and 3.5% for the full year. The percentage of phone activations on
device payment plans increased to approximately 77% in the fourth quarter, compared with about 70% in the third quarter and about 67% in the
fourth quarter of 2015.

We expect the first-quarter take rate for device payment plans to be similar to 4Q as two-year service contracts are no longer available for upgrades
by the embedded base. At the end of the quarter, approximately 46% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan.

Improving the cost structure of our Wireless segment is a priority. We see additional opportunities to increase efficiencies in our operating model
through the continued application of our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes.

On total revenues, our EBITDA wireless margin was 36.9% for the fourth quarter and 43.8% for the year. In terms of profitability, we generated $8.6
billion of EBITDA in the quarter, a decrease of 5.2%. For the full year, total EBITDA was $39.0 billion, an increase of 0.2%.

As expected, the equipment promotional activity in the quarter was elevated given the holiday season. We will remain competitive in the marketplace.

In the fourth quarter, overall traffic on LTE increased by approximately 49%, while we extended our lead in the industry's third-party performance
studies across the country. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.5 billion in the quarter and $11.2 billion for the full year.

Now let's turn to slide 9 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth.

In the fourth quarter, we added high-quality retail postpaid net additions of 591,000 with a sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone
and total phone net adds. We added 552,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which are partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones,
resulting in 456,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 167,000, which included a net decline of basic phones.

Tablet net additions totaled 196,000, which was 764,000 less than last year, due to lower gross adds and higher churn resulting from previous years'
promotions. Full-year postpaid net additions of 2.3 million included 1.8 million of 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablets. The primary offset
to these net additions was net declines in basic phones and 3G smartphones.

Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million for the fourth quarter and to 15.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on
customer retention resulted in retail postpaid phone churn of less than 0.9%. Overall, our retail postpaid churn increased year over year due to
higher tablet churn to 1.1%.

Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.1 million in the quarter, down 1.9%, and 43.2 million for the full year, down 7.3%. About 85% of these
activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations.

About 8.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, up sequentially and consistent with prior year. During the
quarter 8.6 million phones were activated on device payment plans.

Net prepaid devices declined by 9,000 in the quarter, compared to a decline of 157,000 in the prior year. We are seeing sustained year-over-year
improvement in retail prepaid.

We ended the year with 114.2 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading
postpaid connections base grew 2.1% to 108.8 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million.

Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide 10.

In the Wireline segment consumer revenue increased 0.2% and mass markets, which includes small business, declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, consumer revenues expanded by 0.4% and mass markets declined by 0.3%.

Fios total revenue again increased 4.4% in the fourth quarter and increased 4.6% in 2016. Fios revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase
in the total customer base and strong demand for higher internet speeds. In Fios internet, we added 68,000 net customers for the quarter and
235,000 for the year. We now have a total of about 5.7 million Fios internet subscribers, representing 40.4% penetration.

In Fios Video, we added 21,000 net customers in the quarter and 59,000 for the year, and now have a total of 4.7 million Fios video subscribers,
which represents a 34.3% penetration. Similar to prior quarters, we continue to see strong demand for custom TV offerings. Our One Fiber initiative
in Boston is progressing as expected and we launched consumer and business services to customers late in the fourth quarter.

We continue to innovate with our Fios platform, utilizing our fiber assets and earlier this month we introduced Instant Internet, which is a new
service that offers both upload and download speeds of 750 megabits per second. This service was introduced in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia,
and Richmond, and other markets will see the service soon.

Let's turn to slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale, as well as the Wireline segment in total.

Global enterprise revenue declined 4.5% and, on a constant currency basis, was down about 4% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, global
enterprise revenue declined 3.6% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3%.

In our wholesale business, as expected, revenues declined 7.5% in the fourth quarter due to the impact of nonrecurring items in the prior year. For
the year, wholesale revenue declined 4.9%.

Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 3.1% in the quarter and 2.3% for the full year. The impacts of the labor contract,
workforce reduction, and tight cost control supported improved profitability while maintaining strong customer satisfaction.

The segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. We expect to see continuing improvement on an annual basis with
seasonal fluctuations. Capital spending in Wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $4.5 billion for the year.

Regarding our pending Wireline transactions, we expect the acquisition of XO Communications to close in the first quarter and the data center
transaction to close in the second quarter. Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss our strategic position.

Entering 2017, we are confident in our strategy and priorities for future growth and profitability. The foundation of the three-tier strategy begins
with our commitment to invest in our best-in-class networks. Above the network layer resides our platform layer, which we are developing and
creating new business models to monetize the ever-increasing digital traffic growth.

Our goal is to be the trusted provider of connecting people and things and providing scalable solutions and analytics. Network quality and leadership
is the cornerstone of this strategy and at the forefront of our brand value proposition to our customers. Today we are the largest and most reliable
4G network in the country, with market-leading fiber assets.

To expand our network leadership, we are executing on our strategic efforts to densify the 4G network, increase fiber resources, and enhance
spectral efficiency. As I noted earlier, we have initiated our next-generation fiber network deployments in Boston.

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Fiber is an important element of our Wireless networks, as it allows us to strengthen our 4G LTE capacity while also preparing for 5G. Our pending
XO Communications acquisition will add to our fiber footprint and provide us with additional metro rings in 45 out of the top 50 US markets.

5G wireless technology is a focus for us. We are now launching about 10 precommercial pilots across the country with multiple use cases, including
dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. Our goal is to test the 5G fixed wireless technology in different environments in order to successfully
operationalize 5G products for a commercial launch.

As noted earlier, we are expanding platforms and building new business models to monetize digital mobile video traffic on our network. In our
media assets, AOL's content and ad tech capabilities have enhanced our video offerings. With a focus on delivering timely short-form versions of
video clips, we have seen digital video consumption gain traction in the last year.

At the content and solutions layer of our three-tier strategy the combination of AOL, go90, and other content has enabled cross-platform sharing.
This strategy expands our distribution and revenue opportunities globally across carriers and networks. We have seen increased usage in the go90
application through this exchange and we are expanding our unique content offerings.

The average daily usage in go90 was consistent sequentially at about 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% set of traffic served on the Verizon
Wireless network in the second half of the year. We are actively leveraging our content portfolio and have strategically focused on an ad-supported
model. In 2016, through our joint venture with Hearst, we launched unique content through Complex Media and AwesomenessTV and we are
looking forward to expanding these offerings this year.

In addition, our extensive digital rights portfolio, including sports such as NFL and NBA, provided enhanced viewing experiences such as launching
Stream Pass to Verizon Wireless customers across multiple demographics. Our pending Yahoo acquisition would further increase our opportunity
to scale in the digital media space with its 1 billion-plus monthly average unique viewers. We are still working with Yahoo to assess the impact of
the breaches and we have not yet reached any final conclusions yet.

The Internet of Things, including telematics, is an area of opportunity that is rapidly growing as the connected world expands. Ubiquitous and
reliable coverage to support the vast number of devices expected on these various platforms is a competitive advantage and we are developing
this ecosystem to leverage our best-in-class networks, while providing solutions to verticals such as transportation, energy, agriculture, and smart
cities.

The great example of this is in the telematics space, with acquisitions of both Telogis and Fleetmatics we became the market share leader. Our
smart city solutions continue to progress and the business is augmented with the acquisitions of Sensity and LQD WiFi. As a result, we now have
a deep inventory of solutions on our IoT platform to provide to our customers.

Overall, we are confident in our ability to execute, deliver results, and return value to our shareholders while continuously transforming the business.
As we look at our current and pending assets in the media and IoT businesses, we will be focused on integrating these assets by increasing global
scale organically and further enhancing cross-platform content sharing opportunities.

Collectively, these assets allow us to participate in the global ecosystem of the connected world. We see a clear path to revenue contributions from
these integrated assets, which will drive returns to the overall business in a less capital-intensive manner.

Now let's turn to slide 13 to review 2017 priorities.

In 2017 our focus will be leveraging our network leadership position. We will focus on retaining and growing our high-quality customer base in
both Wireless and Wireline, while balancing profitability in this dynamic environment. Enhancing ecosystems in media and the Internet of Things,
led by telematics, will further drive the monetization of our network and solutions both domestic and globally.

We expect full-year consolidated revenue on an organic basis to be fairly consistent with that of 2016, with improvement in Wireless service revenue
and equipment revenue trends. We also expect full-year consolidated adjusted EPS trends to be similar to consolidated revenue trends.

Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2017: consolidated capital spending between $16.8 billion and $17.5 billion; minimum pension
funding requirement of approximately $600 million; and in terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes
to be in the range of 34% to 36%, based on current legislation. We will execute on the long-term strategy to position the business for the future.

With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP, IR

Thank you, Matt. Tori, we are now ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Thanks very much. Good morning. Matt, maybe we could start with the last point on the guidance.

Can you just give us a reconciliation of the new guidance versus the previous GDP-type growth and normal type EPS? What are the changes that
are causing that?

And on EPS specifically, can you just help us reconcile what the base number that you will be using for sort of a flat kind of organic number would
be, for all the adjustments with Frontier and the labor dispute, etc.? Thank you.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thank you, Simon, for the question. Good morning. Let's start with the outlook we gave this morning and I'll start with the revenue. As you saw
from that, we said we expect to see it consistent with 2016 on an organic basis and we continue to see the revenue trajectory of the business
improve.

So as you saw in the release, we expect that to be fairly consistent on an organic basis, so this is an improvement over 2016, when revenue declined
2.4% on a comparable basis. Let's unpack that for a second and see how we get to that improvement from the negative 2.4% up to something
that's more comparable.

Obviously, the major driver is Wireless, where total revenue was down 2.7% last year and service revenue was down 5.4%. So if we look into the
service revenue component there, that trajectory improved throughout the year.

We started in the first quarter of 2016 down 6.2%. We ended the year in the fourth quarter down 4.9% and the year as a whole averaged down
5.4%, as I said. So as we expect that trend to continue to get better, we should see a better number year over year in Wireless service revenue.

Equipment revenue should also be higher, given the higher device payment take rate, which we expect to be similar to what we saw in the fourth
quarter, which was at 77%. And so obviously improvement in Wireless will be the biggest factor year over year.

And as you look at the other parts of the business, we expect Wireline revenue trends to be similar to 2016; and then media co, we expect that will
continue to build off the progress made last year. And then within the IoT businesses, obviously including telematics, that grew at 21% in the fourth

quarter and we expect that business to continue to grow at a very healthy pace. So, on a combined basis, we are confident in seeing a better
revenue trajectory in 2017 than last year.

When you talk about the -- how we gave the outlook on revenue versus what we've been saying previously, I think the biggest item you've got to
look at in there is Wireless service revenue. So we continue to make good progress transitioning the base to unsubsidized service pricing.

As customers come out of their two-year subsidy plans, we see them quickly migrate to the unsubsidized service pricing. We ended the year with
67% of postpaid customers now on those unsubsidized pricing plans. And so, while we were happy to have seen the acceleration, it does provide
a headwind to service revenue.

And then additionally within service revenue, we saw a higher level of migrations than in past pricing changes to the plans that we introduced in
the middle of last year. That functionality of those new plans appealed to our base and we saw customers take advantage of that and optimize
their plans. So those two developments especially have essentially pushed out our expectation of the timing of service revenue to return to
year-over-year growth from the end of 2017 into 2018.

And so then, as you look at the earnings side of it, obviously the largest driver of EPS changes is what happens in the Wireless service revenue.
Obviously, with service revenue being $66 billion, more than [half](corrected by company after the call) of our total revenue, it's the largest driver.
So that's -- we continue to work through that service review migration.

It is offset by the strong cost management we have had across the business and that has been a hallmark of our performance over the past few
years, using the Verizon Lean Six Sigma program that you've heard us talk about previously. And that will continue to produce significant benefits
in 2017. We will also see a full-year benefit in 2017 from the new labor contract.

So when you factor in all of the above, we expect to produce strong earnings again in 2017. And we talked about the trend we expect on EPS.
You've obviously got the impact in 2016 of one year of the Frontier properties in the first quarter and obviously the work stoppage, but in total it
will be around -- the revenue lines, they will be around where we were in 2016 as the baseline of our view for 2017.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Okay. So just to be clear, on the EPS, we should take the EPS that you reported for 2016 as the base for 2017?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

That's a reasonable starting point, yes.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Okay, great. Then just one last thing on the optimization; has that sort of faded at this point or is that -- is that still continuing at quite a pace? Was
that kind of a three- or four-month effect? Are you still seeing a lot of that going on?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

We are seeing that still continue, but we saw it at certainly an aggressive pace initially after we launched those plans. That just means the base
moved quicker to those plans than we'd seen in other changes. So we're excited that we launched product features that were of high level of
interest to our customers.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Great. Thanks, Matt.

Operator

Phil Cusick, JPMorgan.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Thanks. Just a follow-up first on Simon's question. Can you give us explicitly what the revenue number you're looking at in 2016 as sort of the
normal number, as well as the earnings number?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, the normal number for 2016 would be the comparable against the down 2.4% when you adjust out for the acquisitions over the course of the
couple of years.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Sorry (multiple speakers) so exactly the dollar number that we should be starting with as the baseline to build from.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

I'll come back to you on that one to say we refer off the down 2.4% year over year. It adjusts out for the transactions in both 2016 and also the AOL
introduction in 2015. So when you adjust for both of those, the number --.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Right, and I'm just -- I'm sorry; go ahead, Mike.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP, IR

I was just going to say we will get you that exact number because it is both taking out Frontier for the first quarter as well as we do make an
adjustment because we didn't have a full year of AOL. So that's how we get to the negative 2.4%.

But effectively what we are saying is that, organically, that was not including any of the growth for new businesses; that would be the consistent
number. But we will get you that exact number.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Okay. Then just to make sure; when you talk about better trends -- and it sounds like you are looking for stability -- that revenue number you are
looking for dollars of stability year over year; not stable down-tick in percentages, correct?

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Correct.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Not down 2% [revenue] (multiple speakers)?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Correct. Consistent on a dollar basis year over year and we get there through seeing improvements in the trend on the service revenue trajectory,
the equipment revenue trajectory, so in total across Wireless. And then also the newer businesses, whether it be media co or across the Internet
of Things businesses, we continue to expect to see those -- the revenue from those businesses improve in 2017.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Okay, that makes sense. Then on earnings is it $3.86 that we are using as the baseline from 2016 to jump off into 2017? Or is that a different number?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

I'd go off of the $3.87 that we had on an adjusted basis, adjusting out for the mark-to-market and other items.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

$3.87, got it. Then if I -- just to add one more new one. You talked about the GAAP tax 34% to 36%. How should we think about cash taxes in 2017
under the current legislation?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

We would expect cash taxes to converge towards the effective tax rate during 2017.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

So a higher cash tax rate in 2017 than 2016?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, the cash tax is just purely on income. Obviously our cash taxes for 2016 did include $3.2 billion of taxes related to the Frontier transaction. We
would expect to have cash taxes in 2017 related to the disposal of the data centers when that occurs at a lower level, but on the organic tax on
earnings, we would expect the cash taxes to be closer to the ETR during the course of 2017.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Okay. And do you have any initial thought on what the different plans of tax changes could be? Anything you can help us as we model out the
different impacts from order adjustments and things like that?

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

As we look at taxes we certainly -- look, it's a little too soon to tell. We certainly are supportive of changes in the tax legislation. We believe that we
need to get to a more competitive tax environment and we look forward to working with Congress and the new administration as they try and
put new tax rates forward.

Certainly a reduction in the rate would be beneficial. 100% expensing of CapEx would be beneficial initially, but the plans being discussed also
include items such as removal of the interest expense deduction. And then, as you mentioned, we are all trying to understand exactly how border
adjustability may or may not work.

So certainly believe that tax reform would be a benefit to us, whichever year is the first year it applies to. Whether it applies to 2017 or whether it
initially applied to 2018, it would definitely -- we are definitely seeing it being a benefit to the cash taxes we pay. But given the uncertainty on the
specifics of the plans, it's a little too soon to say exactly how much that could be.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Can you give us an idea of within your CapEx and OpEx what, either a dollar or a percent, comes from overseas? Then I'll stop, sorry.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

I don't think we've disclosed that number previously, so we would have to go back and look that up. But, no, we are not going to disclose that at
this time.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Thanks very much.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP, IR

Phil, there is a reconciliation of the number for revenue that we are using in our financials that we released this morning on our website, but the
number is $121.8 billion. So $121.8 billion would be the base for the revenue as we discussed.

Phil Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

Thanks, Mike. Great.

John Hodulik, UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Great, thanks. Maybe another follow-up on the guidance. Matt, obviously there's a lot of moving parts, but with the revenue trends and EPS trends
sort of mirroring each other it seems to suggest roughly sort of flattish margins. But you're leaving the year with real strength in wireline profitability,
so first of all, if you could talk about what's driving that.

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

And the expectation is for that to continue. Does that imply that the margins on the Wireless side looking out into 2017 should be flat to maybe
even down? And maybe talk a little bit about that trend, especially given the help that you should see from the removal of subsidies in the year.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, John, for the question. Starting off with Wireline, certainly Wireline had a good result in the fourth quarter. I would tell you, as we said in
our prepared remarks, that we would expect Wireline margins for 2017 and the year as a whole to be higher than they were in 2016. And you will
see some seasonal fluctuations in there, as we typically do, so I would tell you it would be reasonable to expect Wireline margins for the year as a
whole to be in the low 20%s compared to the 19% that we saw for 2016.

So we see a lot of improvements going through the business there. Obviously, we're going to have the full-year benefit of the new labor contract
through there and we continue to manage costs in that business very closely in line with the revenue trajectories. We continue to see kind of similar
revenue trajectories for the enterprise and wholesale businesses and are excited about the Fios business, which was up last year 4.6% on a full-year
basis for Fios revenues, and we continue to have more open-for-sale properties there that creates opportunities as we head into 2017.

On overall margins, and you talk about the Wireless margins, this always comes back to where the service revenue trajectory is going to be. And
so we certainly see improvements in service revenue year over year, but we do go into the year off that 4.9% jump-off point from the fourth quarter
and we expect to see that continue to improve as we head into 2017. But as I said, we now see the point at which we get back to year-over-year
positive number pushing out into 2018.

And so I would expect us to continue to have very strong margins in the Wireless business, but it's going to be off of that service revenue trajectory
continuing to be slightly negative, though in an improving direction.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Do you think that on a net basis you can keep those Wireless margins flattish?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, we will continue to aim to produce strong margins in that business and certainly believe that we have the ability to maintain a premium pricing
in the market. That will certainly be our aim as we go through the year.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Great. Thanks, Matt.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. First, Matt, obviously a lot of focus on the guidance. Taking maybe $2 billion to $3 billion of
revenue out of that number; it feels like something has changed on the ground competitively that is making you have to really get more aggressive
on the EIP side and then the promotional side.

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Do you feel like Verizon needs to go to market more aggressively with an unlimited product, like each of your competitors has and is kind of leading
with these days? If you could talk about your view; we all knew Fran's views on the economics of that, but I would love to hear what your perspective
is on the necessity that you do that and your ability to do that if you chose to.

Then the second thing, just now with Ajit Pai's elevation to the Chair, do we have greater clarity on the likelihood that we're going to be getting
rid of the privacy rules specifically aimed at telecom; also the opportunity to maybe more aggressively monetize broadband? Could you talk a little
bit about some of the opportunities and actions that you might be taking right now to prepare for the next regulatory wave? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thank you, David. I'll start with your first question. As we look at our market position, it's based off the product offering and we have the best
network performance out there, which is a major criteria in the user experience.

Despite the claims of others, third-party studies continue to demonstrate the superiority of our network and this network leadership position,
obviously, allows us to maintain a premium price for our service in the marketplace. So as I look at it, our service revenues plus installment billing,
so the total amount we're actually billing a customer each month, that increased 2% in 2016. So that demonstrates our offerings continue to be a
competitive and resonate in the marketplace.

We constantly monitor the competitive market; look for opportunities to compete more effectively. An example of that, we recently launched new
single-line pricing which we believe was an underpenetrated market for us. Our pricing is disciplined to provide a return for our premium service.

There is a number of different offers out there. We saw some folks go to unlimited; we saw some bundling of content and so on in the marketplace.
We continue to assess where we are in there, and as I say, I think our results -- we had 167,000 net phone adds in the quarter, so I believe our
positioning continues to be competitive.

We constantly look at to what's out there. Unlimited is one of the things that some of our competition has at this point in time; that's not something
we feel the need to do. But as I say, we continually monitor the market and we will see where we head in the future.

In terms of your second question, so look, there's a lot of changes going on in DC right now. Obviously yesterday we saw the announcement that,
as you mentioned, of Ajit Pai and so that may have a number of impacts across the regulatory space, but I think it's just too soon to tell exactly
where we are going to be. We look forward to working with the regulators, whether it's the FCC or others.

The other thing that I would mention, though, as you think about that, we make investments for many years given the nature of the business that
we are in. And our investments aren't focused on just who happens to be in office today. We're making investments that are for 10-plus years and
I think our record stands for itself, that irrespective whoever the administration is run by and the regulatory regime, that we are effective. And that
will continue to be how we focus our investments.

I'd say we look forward to working with the new administration and the new leadership in the FCC, and we expect to continue to be competitive
in whatever environment we are operating in.

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt, given the comments that you made in the press release about getting the balance sheet back to the pre-Vodafone deal levels, how much
room does that leave you before 2018, 2019 for strategic transactions? There's been a lot of speculation about the types of things that you might
do in this new environment, whether it's content or wireline or spectrum or none of the above.

I wonder if you could just give us some thoughts on how much flexibility you have and how you think about the various vectors of opportunity
for you.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Craig. As you mentioned, we have been on this path to getting back to the pre-Vodafone credit metrics by 2018-2019 and that is part of
our overall capital allocation. We have been able to be consistent with investing in our networks on a continuous basis, making that improvement
in the balance sheet, and also returning value to shareholders.

And since the Vodafone transaction we've had a number of activities that we have done, whether that be AOL, some of the other acquisitions in
IoT, such as Fleetmatics. We've also divested of businesses, whether it be the Tower transaction as an example. And so we have been able to
continually make strategic transactions while staying consistent to each part of that capital allocation policy.

That will be our intent to continue to do so. As we head into 2017, we believe that we will be able to continue to maintain that capital allocation
policy that allows us to deliver on all three of those key areas.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson - Analyst

Matt, can you comment on how you think about the various options out there, whether it's content or wireline or spectrum or something else?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Obviously, look, I'm not going to comment on any specific combinations that have been rumored over the years and certainly we are not able to
talk specifically about spectrum right now, given that we are in the incentive auction.

So we will continue to look for opportunities to expand and grow the business. Lowell and I are completely aligned that we will be disciplined in
any investment activity. We evaluate all options, whether that is build, buy, or partner for our strategic positioning, and the key criteria is creating
long-term value for the business and shareholders.

We will continue to look for the right things to do to position the business to be successful in the future. And that is -- we do that on an everyday
basis and we will continue to do so. And I think we've successfully done that over the past few years.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson - Analyst

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Mike Rollins - Citigroup - Analyst

Thanks and good morning. Two, if I could. First, if you could talk about how the 5G business case is progressing from a financial perspective. And,
Matt, what are the key metrics that you are looking for from the team that's working on the business case to facilitate a green light of commercial
deployment? Is there certain costs metrics, like per home passed, or certain other metrics that you are focused on?

Then, just if I could follow-up on a clarification. I think you mentioned that in terms of thinking about flat organic revenue for 2017, you took the
revenue for 2016 and you subtracted the divestiture of markets to Frontier and you subtracted AOL. Can you help us think through what the
add-backs then are for 2017 with the number of pending and completed acquisitions that you announced and are still in progress? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. Let me start off with 5G. Look, we had good progress in 2016, as we discussed throughout the year. We had a number of technical
trials and lab scale trials which we completed and so we've now moved on to the next phase of that, which is some of these commercial scale pilots
that are getting underway right now in about 10 different locations around the country.

We are very excited about the opportunities that 5G brings. We will see how those trials go and we look forward to sharing progress with you on
those as we move forward throughout the year.

You asked around key metrics. I think it's going to be the same as any major investment we could be looking at, just a combination of what's the
cost to rollout 5G. We get into questions about how -- the distance from the node; how many homes can you cover from any particular node? What
speeds can we get? What's the cost of putting that there, etc., etc.?

XO obviously brings something to that by adding additional fiber to the base as we think about rolling out the infrastructure needed for 5G. And
-- but it's the same as any investment, Mike. We are going to look at the revenue opportunity we think we can get based off of the results of the
tests that are underway right now, compare that with the cost, and if it provides a great return for shareholders, we will certainly move ahead with
launching commercially. And if -- it will be the same as any other investment; we will look at it the same way.

In terms of your second question on 2016, you're right; the baseline is reducing the Frontier divestiture and also AOL, because we only had it for
partially -- part of the year in 2015. So then if you think about total revenue for 2017, it would include obviously the full year of AOL this year. We
expect XO to kick in later this quarter.

We expect the IoT businesses -- you're going to have the full year of Fleetmatics and Telogis and the other IoT acquisitions. And then, assuming
the Yahoo transaction closes, you will have the revenue from there, too. So when you think about building on the number that Mike mentioned,
the $121 billion, you got all those things to layer on top of that to get to the expectation for the full year.

Obviously, as it relates to pending transactions, it will be contingent on the timing of those as well. So hopefully that answers your question on
that.

Mike Rollins - Citigroup - Analyst

Thanks very much.

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Thanks for taking the question. If I look at your CapEx guidance for the full year, it essentially seems you're guiding to flat, plus or minus a reasonable
range. I was hoping you could maybe unpack that a little bit.

And just thinking about your network strategy and your product strategy, what areas are you accelerating capital investment inside the business?
Maybe where do you feel like you've done a good job building out your network where it needs to be? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Brett. As you think about the CapEx, as you say, the number is reasonably consistent year after year and that's something you've seen from
us for a number of years. But, as you say, within that it changes over time.

So within LTE our spending continues to transition from coverage to densifying the network. And that continues to evolve as we leverage new
technologies around radio and hardware and software and then refarming our spectrum within 4G and densifying with small cell.

So you will continue to see that densification of the 4G network. And that includes how we put fiber out there, which obviously is needed for the
4G network, but also is something that we think about for prepositioning for 5G. So you will continue to see that.

You will continue to see us launch additional parts of LTE Advanced as we go through that. We had the initial launch of that last year. We expect
additional features to come during the course of this year and we will continue to expand our C-RAN architecture.

So within Wireless you should expect to see the spending continue to move to make the network more efficient on a cost-per-gig basis going
forward. Then, as we've mentioned, fiber is a consistent part of our business so that is something you should expect to see us continue in. We've
talked about what we're doing in Boston; you should continue to see us do that.

Some of the other businesses aren't -- as we've said previously, they are not as capital intensive as our network business, so you should expect to
see that CapEx will continue to be focused on the network side of the business as we go into 2017.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Just a quick question as a follow-up around where you're investing; you talked about the precommercial, the 5G commercial trials you're running.
Are those predominantly within your wireline footprint? Or do you actually think that when you are ready to go commercial you have a business
case to go in whatever markets look like they have the best demographics, regardless of whether you are an incumbent wireline provider or not?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

It's not just in the ILEC footprint; it's across the country and we certainly see the opportunity to deploy 5G solutions across the country as well. Once
we get comfortable with it, they are ready to be launched out on a commercial basis.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

So you could do One Fibers in markets across the country, not just in Boston?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, certainly we're looking at how we would support the 5G network across the country, both in and outside the ILEC footprint.

Mike McCormack, Jefferies.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies - Analyst

Thanks. Matt, maybe just a clarification on your comments regarding service revenue turning positive. Just give us a sense; obviously optimization
continues, but is that predicated on a stable pricing environment in your view?

Secondly, on the retention side, it looks like you've got about a 21% delta between those that are on unsubsidized plans versus those making
device payments. Is that fair? And then, as we think about that, how much of that is bring your own device versus off-contract versus your own
retention efforts?

And then, if you don't mind, a final one. Based on our math, it looks like you still have about 13.1-ish-million feature phones out there, so
non-smartphones. What is the strategy to try to move those over to smartphones or try to retain them to prevent headwinds on handsets as we
look into 2017?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Mike; I'll start with the last one. Look, we certainly like it when customers migrate from feature phones to an LTE smartphone, but we are
also very happy for those customers that just want a feature phone. They are not looking for the additional functionality, but they want to be
connected to a great network. We are very happy to continue to have those as customers and we look forward to continuing to have offerings that
meet their needs as well.

In terms of service revenue, and I think you talked about the gap between the 46% of our customers who have a device payment plan and the 67%
of our base who now are on unsubsidized pricing. That's a factor of as customers come out of their two-year service contracts and they move over
to that pricing without necessarily upgrading a handset and we expect that will continue.

That delta between those two numbers will be those customers who have either come out of two-year subsidy and moved over to the unsubsidized
pricing. They could be -- we now have customers who took out a device payment plan over two years ago who have completed those payments
and are now no longer making a device payment every month. And as you say, BYOD continues to be part of that base, too.

So you should expect there continue to be a delta between those two numbers, because not everyone on unsubsidized pricing is going to have
a current device plan. We see that continuing as we go into the year and part of the (multiple speakers) migrating over to device payment.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies - Analyst

Sorry, just a clarification. I guess I'm trying to get to how much of that -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- but the actual percentage of that that is you going
into actively retain customers that are still on contract, to reduce their price point without losing a customer. Is there some component of that as
well?

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, the vast majority of our two-year customers who have gone on to the unsubsidized pricing is when they've come to the end of that. We typically
-- customer has to get through their two-year price plan, if they are on that two-year service contract, before they would then be able to come to
the unsubsidized pricing.

When you look at our churn, I think what you're trying to get to is that phone churn that was below 0.9%. And that is not because we are bringing
customers onto that pricing before they've moved there. I think that continued strong churn represents the value our base sees in the service they
get and the high quality of the network that they have when they are a Verizon customer.

It's only when they come out of their two-year contract do they move over to -- have the opportunity to move over to unsubsidized pricing.

Mike McCormack - Jefferies - Analyst

Thanks for the clarification. Just on the service revenue expectations, is that -- stable pricing is the expectation there or expecting additional
promotions as we look at 2017?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, we expect to continue to compete in the marketplace as throughout 2016. We did various promotions throughout the year; I would expect
us to continue to at different times of the year have different promotions out there. But I expect, based off that, we will compete effectively in the
marketplace.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thanks very much and good morning. Just a quick follow-up on Brett's questions on fiber. Specifically, how should we think about your future fiber
needs?

It seems like in some context you are willing to shed certain assets, but have also acquired others, and are also working with third-party providers.
In some cases, overbuilding in areas such as Boston.

What I'm trying to understand is that based on your actions, it seems as though not all fiber assets are created equal. And so how do you get to
the point where you have the right fixed assets in the right locations to support your network vision? And I've just got a brief follow-up.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Good morning, Amir. Thank you for that. Fiber is going to be a critical asset for us. It's a critical asset today and it will certainly continue to be so as
we go into the future.

JANUARY 24, 2017 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2016 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

One thing it allows us to do -- and this certainly is within our footprint -- is it replaces the core copper networks that have served us well over the
years. But from a capability standpoint and also just a maintenance standpoint, it certainly makes a lot of sense for us to continue to replace copper
with fiber. Then, as you say, fiber is going to be critical for us as we densify 4G and think about 5G. That explains why the XO transaction was
interesting to us; getting those metro rings in 45 of the top 50 markets.

The other thing you have seen us do in Boston was really look at this One Fiber approach, which was building a network in a way that provides a
common fiber infrastructure to serve a number of different needs, whether that be consumers in in-home or out-of-home, and then obviously our
small, medium, and enterprise customers, too.

So you should continue to see us deploy fiber. How we deploy that fiber can differ from location to location. We certainly look where it makes sense
for us to own the fiber, but if there is ways for us to partner with other people or they can build the fiber on our behalf, we certainly do that as well.

So it's a location-by-location, case-by-case basis. We look at the economics and we decide the best way to get to the fiber assets that we need. And
we think about that it's not just the fiber assets that we need for what we are doing today, but as we think about the network going out into the
future. You should continue to see us make investments in fiber as we go forward and position the network to service the business well into the
future.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Great. Just a quick follow-up on your 2017 outlook. What type of factors do you take into account on any potential changes to the competitive
landscape? In particular, Comcast has highlighted that they expect to launch their WiFi MVNO strategy in the back half of the year.

Given you folks are partnered there, I was wondering what you are factoring in with respect to that partnership in terms of size and impact to both
your financials and potentially the competitive landscape.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Yes, so as I think about -- look, we know they said they expect to launch that later in the year. We'll have to wait to see what it is.

As we've said previously, look, we've been in the wholesale business for many years. We are happy to be in that business and we would sign that
agreement again if the opportunity came up. But, look, we don't expect that to necessarily have a major impact during the course of 2017. They've
got a lot of work to do there and I'll let them talk about their strategy on that.

But as I think about the competitive environment as a whole, I would expect it to continue to evolve in ways that -- some of which we may guess
and others of which we will have to wait and see how they play out. But what I would remind you is that we've seen many different competitive
environments over the past 15, 20 years in wireless and I think the one constant has been the way that we have always competed effectively
whatever the environment. And I would highly expect us to do the same thing in 2017.

Michael Stefanski - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP, IR

Thank you for your questions. Tori, before we end the call I would like to turn the call back to Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. I would like to close this session with a few key points. In 2016 we delivered solid results in a competitive environment. We added
quality customers while leading the industry in network performance and customer retention. We had solid financial results generating cash flow
and shareholder return.

JANUARY 23, 2018 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to join today's call to talk about 2017 results, the implications of tax reform to Verizon,
and then to talk about our strategic priorities for 2018.

Let me start off by recapping our impressive performance this year. I'm proud of the focus and the execution from our team in 2017. We regained
positive momentum in the marketplace and delivered strong operational and financial results.

We launched and expanded the most reliable unlimited experience for our customers, executed the world's largest successful 5G precommercial
trial, invested in assets and platforms for the future, and gained significant traction in the integration of new businesses.

We finished the year with great momentum in the fourth quarter as evidenced by our smartphone net additions and reoccurring levels of outstanding
customer loyalty. In addition, the improvement in our wireless service revenue trajectory positions the business for growth moving forward.

The integration of new businesses is accelerating our mobile-first digital strategy and providing a platform for global reach. In 2017, we made
significant progress with our Oath assets as we build engaging brands around the key pillars of news, sports, finance, and lifestyle and we leverage
the Oath capabilities across all of our Verizon properties.

The game-changing content and technology partnerships that we recently announced with the NFL and NBA are great examples of how we are
accelerating our digital rights strategy with Yahoo Sports and Verizon's family of digital media brands. We are becoming the first screen for fans
of live sports and superior partners for advertisers, positioning us to show live action in the engaging ways people want to consume video content.

We are investing for the future while maintaining a well-rounded approach to funding all aspects of our business. We enhanced our financial profile
in 2017 with a number of transactions that strengthened the balance sheet, that included lowering our borrowing costs, extending out our debt
maturities, and making a significant voluntary contribution to the pension fund.

Now let's take a look forward. We ended the year with the President signing tax reform into law, effectively restructuring the tax code for US
corporations. Verizon has long supported corporate tax reform that reduces rates to globally competitive levels and we are very pleased to see
this legislation passed.

The new tax law will have a positive impact to Verizon's cash flow and earnings profile. We expect tax reform to enhance our cash flow from
operations in 2018 by approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion.

We have been disciplined in our approach to capital allocation since the inception of Verizon. We have always been focused on keeping our network
the gold standard and investing in the business for growth while strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining strong dividend performance
for our shareholders.

This will continue to be the driving force behind the use of cash savings from tax reform, and by strengthening the balance sheet, it will give us
the flexibility to execute our strategies going forward.

Our employees drive the innovation and success of our business, so it's vital that we all share in the success of not only tax reform, but the overall
performance of Verizon. We will provide details on how we are investing in our employees later today and we'll provide those details outside the
Company later today.

We are good corporate citizens and share our success with the community. In 2017, Verizon and its foundation donated $75 million for disaster
recovery and community projects. We will increase our contributions to the Verizon Foundation by $200 million to $300 million over the next 2
years with the additional funds being dedicated to our efforts around Humanability.

And by Humanability, we mean applying our technology to making our customers' lives better. Combined, these two initiatives will have an
approximate $0.05 to $0.06 impact to our earnings per share for each of the next two years.

JANUARY 23, 2018 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

As we head into 2018, our strategic priorities remain clear and are unchanged. The cornerstone of our strategy continues to be our best-in-class
Wireless network, which continues to be ranked number one in the nation in both voice and data network quality. Our unbroken run of J.D. Power
and RootMetrics awards keeps getting longer.

In our history, Verizon has always been on the forefront of technology innovation. We've led the transformation of the wireless industry from analog
to today's fourth-generation LTE service. Now we have an unprecedented opportunity in front of us as we drive the evolution of the US wireless
industry to the fifth generation of mobile services.

Not too long ago, people were saying 5G would not be possible until sometime between 2020 and 2022. Only one carrier has been consistent in
its actions and messaging regarding 5G. Verizon has the spectrum bandwidth needed to provide the rich services of true 5G, our intelligent edge
network capabilities, and engineering know-how to lead the industry in providing the full suite of 5G gigabit services.

The investment in pre-positioning of assets that we have accomplished will enable us to deliver the full range of 5G services, including mobility,
residential broadband, sub-millisecond latency applications, and other advanced consumer and IoT use cases. We have flexed our innovation
muscle and are now taking 5G from a mere possibility to commercial reality by bringing three to five cities online this year with commercial services.

The next Industrial Revolution will be on Verizon's network and will positively impact society like no technology we have seen before. As we say
around our offices, we don't wait for the future; we build it. And we are doing it again with 5G.

Now I will hand the call over to Matt to talk about the financial and operating details of the business, starting with slide 4.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Lowell. It's great to be with you today and to share the results of our strong performance. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we reported earnings
of $4.56 per share and full-year earnings of $7.36 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several special items that I would like
to highlight.

Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss from special items of about $2.6 billion. This net loss consists of severance and mark-to-market
adjustments for pension and OPEB liabilities of $1.2 billion, early debt redemption costs of $681 million, a charge for product realignment around
early-stage developmental technologies of $671 million, acquisition- and integration-related charges of $154 million pertaining mainly to Yahoo,
and a non-cash pre-tax gain on spectrum license transactions of about $144 million.

Additionally, as noted in our 8-K filing last week, the new tax law resulted in a one-time benefit of approximately $16.8 billion or $4.10 per share.
This benefit is primarily related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% corporate income tax rate.

The cumulative net impact from these items after-tax was approximately $15.2 billion or $3.71 per share. Excluding the full effect of these items,
adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 in the fourth quarter, which is flat compared to our performance in the same quarter a year ago. For the full
year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.74.

Now let's move to a summary of the consolidated financial highlights of the quarter on slide 5. In the fourth quarter, total operating revenue was
$34 billion, an improvement of 5%. And for the full year 2017, revenue was $126 billion.

On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and new businesses, adjusted operating revenues declined approximately 2% for the year. For the
full year, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, totaled approximately $45.1 billion and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin
was 35.7%, slightly higher than last year's margin of 35.5%.

Let's turn now to our wireless results on slide 6. Our value proposition of providing unlimited service on the best network together with the simplicity
of our offers is driving increased engagement from our valued customers.

JANUARY 23, 2018 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

In the fourth quarter, total wireless operating revenue increased 1.7% to $23.8 billion, our first positive year-over-year growth in two years. For the
full year, operating revenue totaled $87.5 billion, a decline of 1.9%.

The sequential results in service revenue increased for the second consecutive quarter by 0.2% to $15.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, service
revenues declined by 2.9%, a marked improvement over the same period last year. The improved trends to service revenues are attributed to
several factors, including increased access revenues and new account formation.

Our postpaid phone base migrations to unsubsidized service pricing are progressing and now represent approximately 80% of our postpaid phone
base, approaching steady-state as most of our business customers remain on subsidized plans.

In the fourth quarter, equipment revenue increased to $6.5 billion, up 12.9% for the quarter and 7.8% for the full year. At the end of the quarter,
approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance.

During the quarter, we generated $9.5 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 9.6%. Wireless EBITDA margin was 39.8% compared to approximately 36.9%
in the same period last year. As expected, the improvement in EBITDA was a function of better trends in service revenue and lower promotional
activity than the prior year. For the full year, we generated $38.6 billion of EBITDA on total revenues of $87.5 billion.

Now let's turn to slide 7 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. In the fourth quarter, total smartphone net adds were 647,000
compared to 456,000 last year. Total postpaid net adds were 1.2 million, including phone adds of 431,000, 193,000 tablets, and 550,000 other
connected devices, predominantly wearables. For the third consecutive quarter, we increased customer accounts, adding 40,000 to our base.

For the full year, postpaid net additions of 2.1 million included 774,000 phones, 31,000 tablets, and 1.3 million other connected devices. Our
competitiveness in 2017 was highlighted by smartphone net adds of 1.8 million, up 34% versus prior year.

The overall experience of pairing our unlimited plan with the best network continues to resonate with our customer base, resulting in outstanding
retail postpaid churn of 1.00% and phone churn of 0.77% in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, postpaid churn improved by 10 basis
points, driven primarily by strong phone results.

In the quarter, postpaid device activations totaled 12.4 million, down from 13.1 million last year. About 82% of these activations were phones, with
wearables accounting for the majority of the other device activations.

Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 7.2%, up sequentially as expected, but was lower compared to the prior year. We are seeing the elongation
of the upgrade cycle as more customers hold onto their devices for a longer period. During the quarter, 8.1 million phones were activated on device
payment plans.

Prepaid net additions declined by 184,000 compared to a decline of 9,000 in the prior year. Our smartphone prepaid base increased during the
quarter. All of the decline in prepaid net additions was due to basic prepaid phones, as we have deliberately reduced our focus in that area.

We ended 2017 with 116 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things. Our industry-leading postpaid connections
base grew 1.9% to 111 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million for the year.

Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 8. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment increased 0.1% in the quarter and 0.6% for
the full year. On an organic basis, excluding revenues from our XO acquisition, segment revenues declined in the quarter by 3.6%. Growth from
our high-quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition.

Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.4% in the quarter as Fios Internet growth was overshadowed by declines in video and copper. For the full
year, consumer revenues grew by 0.2%. Consumer Fios revenue grew by 1.7% in the quarter.

JANUARY 23, 2018 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Fios revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher Internet speeds, including our
gigabit connection launched early in 2017. In the quarter, we added 47,000 Fios Internet customers. We now have a total of about 5.9 million Fios
Internet subscribers, representing a 40.1% penetration rate.

In Fios video, the business faced ongoing headwinds as observed throughout the linear TV market. The Fios video business ended with 29,000
subscriber losses in the quarter and 75,000 for the year.

Our multiuse fiber initiative is progressing as expected. This provides the foundational layer for multiple ways to interface with a wide array of
customers and is the cornerstone of our intelligent edge network. We launched our partnership with Boston in 2016 and are seeing good results
in that area.

We announced our public-private partnership with Sacramento in June of 2017. And you will see more activity from us on this front as progressive
municipalities work with Verizon to bring new technologies to their communities.

For the quarter, excluding XO, enterprise solutions revenue decreased 4.1%. New customer wins and growth in advanced communication products
were more than offset by secular and pricing pressures in our legacy offerings and technologies. Partner solutions revenue, excluding XO, decreased
5.8%. Strong demand for fiber access is a growth opportunity for this business.

In business markets, revenue declined 5.6% without XO. We are competing and winning with our fiber-based products, but continue to see declines
in legacy technologies.

Segment EBITDA margin was 20.9% for the quarter and 21.1% for the year. Our commitment to operational gains and efficiencies in the business
were largely offset by content cost escalations producing a stable margin profile.

Let's move next to slide 9 to discuss our media and telematics businesses. Our integration efforts for the Oath assets are progressing ahead of
schedule. We remain focused on exploiting synergies across all of our media assets to create a streamlined platform with rich, engaging content
and simple functionality.

For the quarter, Oath revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately 10% sequentially. As expected, revenue trends were driven by increased
advertising spend during the holiday season. And we expect to see the normal seasonality from fourth quarter to first quarter.

Our telematics business, which includes Fleetmatics and Telogis, continues to grow. Total telematics revenue increased to just over $230 million.
IoT revenues increased approximately 8% in the quarter on an organic basis. Our solution set is evolving as our engagement with municipalities
gains more momentum with increasing multiuse fiber deployments and the commercial rollout of 5G services.

Let's move next to slide 10 to discuss our cash flows. In 2017, cash flow from operations totaled $25.3 billion, including the $2.1 billion net after-tax
discretionary pension funding and the $6.0 billion impact from completing the transition to on-balance sheet device payment receivables financing.
On a year-over-year basis, our cash flows improved by $2.5 billion.

As expected, full-year capital expenditures were $17.2 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $8.1 billion and does not include $4.3 billion of
proceeds from asset-backed securitizations.

The transition to on-balance sheet accounting for device payment plan receivables and funding is now substantially complete. Changes going
forward will mostly reflect seasonality in wireless equipment volumes.

We ended the year with $117.1 billion of total debt comprised of $108.2 billion of unsecured debt and $8.9 billion of on-balance sheet securitizations.
Our near-term unsecured maturities are modest at $2.3 billion through the end of 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us the financial
flexibility to methodically invest for growth in the business.

JANUARY 23, 2018 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Now let's take a look at 2018 on slide 11. As Lowell mentioned up front, our strategic priorities for 2018 are clear. Our focus is on executing on the
fundamentals which positions the business for strong performance in the upcoming year. We expect year-over-year consolidated revenue to grow
at low-single digits in 2018 on a GAAP reported basis.

Excluding the impact from the new revenue recognition standard, we are on track to achieve year-over-year wireless service revenue growth by
the middle part of 2018. As we disclosed in our January 17 8-K filing, the new revenue standard will negatively impact wireless service revenue.
Inclusive of the new standard, we expect wireless service revenue growth to turn positive toward the end of 2018 or early 2019.

The benefits of our business excellence initiative, including the deployment of zero-based budgeting, will begin to show up in our results in 2018.
We expect low-single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share, which includes the dilutive impacts from a full year of depreciation and amortization
costs from 2017 acquisitions, the Straight Path acquisition, expected to close later in the first quarter, and the ongoing impact of last year's data
center divestitures. This is before the impact of tax reform and the revenue recognition standard.

In terms of tax legislation, we expect the savings to generate a net $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion uplift to cash flows from operations in 2018. And it is
expected to yield a $0.55 to $0.65 increase to EPS in 2018. Net of our employee initiative and contributions to the Verizon Foundation that Lowell
mentioned earlier, the resulting 2018 effective tax rate for Verizon is projected to be in the range of 24% to 26%.

Lowell stated earlier that our internal capital decision process and return objectives have not changed. We are consistent and methodical in our
allocation. We expect consolidated capital spending to be between $17.0 billion and $17.8 billion, including the commercial launch of 5G.

With that, I will turn the call back over to Brady so we can get to your questions.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you, Matt. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Philip Cusick, JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

One for Matt and one for Lowell, if I can. First, Matt, I wonder if you can talk about the Company's target leverage. And is there any change in your
thoughts or the discussions with rating agencies on what appropriate EBITDA multiple, when your conversion from EBITDA to cash flow is now
substantially better because of lower taxes?

And then Lowell, can you please discuss Verizon's view of the attractiveness of media assets in general? A year ago, you offered a definitive no on
any interest in buying big media. And yet, Verizon has been thrown out as a potential buyer in nearly every media M&A story of 2017, which has
probably been confusing for your investors. Can you just give us an update? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Good morning, Phil. I will take the first question there. So the target leverage -- we haven't specified an exact number there. But as we've said
consistently, we want to strengthen the balance sheet. The additional proceeds from the benefit of tax reform allow us to get there a little faster.

JANUARY 23, 2018 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

The key here is to have a strong balance sheet that allows us to pursue and execute on our strategy as quickly and as efficiently as we can. So as I
say, we haven't given an exact leverage target, but you should expect us to deleverage from where we are today.

We said previously getting into the same type of profile that we had prior to the Vodafone transaction. So I think that gives you a general view of
the direction we'd like to head.

In terms of the rating agencies, I've not had any specific conversations with them since tax reform happened about how that may change their
views. But certainly it gives us the ability to bring the leverage down at a little faster rate. And we look forward to doing that through 2018 and we
will continue to have conversations with them and put the balance sheet in a place where it continues to support the business.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

And Phil, good morning. I guess my first comment is I guess it's nice to be loved. So there certainly is a lot of interest here, which frankly we ignore.
I think in seriousness, there is a lot of movement in this area right now. We don't even know whether AT&T is going to get approved.

It's clear that the messages that Disney and Fox are sending is that scale matters. So we look at this, but you have to take a look at whether being
a big independent distributor is a reasonable alternative to owning content. And I think until all of this shakes out, you really can't determine
whether that's a path that we'd be interested in.

But I can say unequivocally, there is nothing going on right now with us considering a large media play. In fact, if you look at our actions, things
like the NBA and the NFL announcement that we've made in the last few weeks, we think being a great partner, being able to monetize through
advertising, and being independent is a very good place to play for us right now. And that's -- until further notice, that is what our investors should
assume we are doing.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan - Analyst

That's helpful. Thanks, Lowell. Thanks, Matt.

Operator

Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Great. Thank you very much and good morning. And one for Matt and Lowell as well. Matt, can you just help us with the math from Q4 to Q1 around
the revenue recognition? You are moving some revenues from service revenues to equipment. And then you should get at least a temporary
EBITDA and EPS lift. If you can just give us a little bit more color around what we should be modeling there?

And then, Lowell, you obviously went through the 5G rollout in a lot of detail in November. We are a couple of months past that. Can you give us
a little bit more clarity about what we should be expecting for the rest of the year?

When should we see Sacramento launching? What about announcing some of the other cities? How many POPs should we be expecting covered
in 2018 and then into 2019?

Client Id: 77

JANUARY 23, 2018 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2017 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Simon. So I will take the first part of that on the adoption of revenue recognition. So a couple of things there. Firstly, we created an opening
balance sheet adjustment to reflect some of the treatment of open contracts, assuming they had been recorded under the new standard.

Remember, unlike most adoption of accounting standards, the prior periods are not being recast. And so you will have a little difference between
the accounting standard for the 2018 numbers versus the 2017 comparisons you will see there. So as we go through the year and we report 2018
on the new standard, we will also give a view as what 2018 would have looked like if it had been under the old standard as well.

So in terms of breaking those pieces apart, as we said in the 8-K last week, total revenue won't have any significant impact from the change. But
there will be a change in geography. We will record more equipment revenue and less service revenue initially based off that change and how we
treat contracts that are still subsidized, which is primarily our B2B contracts.

And then the biggest impact to the EBITDA line is going to come from how we treat commissions. And rather than taking those commission
expenses and expensing them immediately when they are incurred, they will get spread over the estimated life of the underlying customer contract.

Now, the opening balance sheet adjustment is only for the open contracts that had a 24-month commitment or promo cost. So it doesn't relate
to all of the contracts. So that's what you will see a buildup in that over the next two years.

So we said the net benefit in 2018 will be about $0.9 billion to $1.2 billion because of the change in accounting standards. Most of that coming
from the commissions line. We didn't break it out by quarter, but I think you should expect it not to be too dissimilar from quarter to quarter as we
go through the year.

And then the impact in 2018 will be bigger than it will be in 2019 and then it will be largely immaterial by the time we get to 2020. Because that
contract asset that builds up on the balance sheet will reach a plateau level where the ins and outs are equal. By the time we get into 2018, they
won't be materially different. So hopefully that answers your question on rev rec.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

And Simon, on 5G. As you indicated, we shared a lot of information in November. The trials are continuing to go extremely well for us. We have
more than 200 sites up online. We continue to learn every day.

The distances that we shared and the throughputs are very consistent up to about 2,000 feet, which is much better than we expected. We are doing
more testing around throughputs. We are seeing 10 gigabits of peak throughput. So we are very comfortable with being able to deliver a gigabit
of service to everyone that we are providing service to.

As you may have seen, the new standard, the global standard, was approved in December. And we have announced with Qualcomm bringing
chips online that will fit that standard in the second half of 2018. So we will be deploying with our proprietary standard, but also very, very quickly
in 2018, coming on with the global standard as well.

If you saw what was going on at CES, there was a lot of discussion about devices. And we believe that there will be mobile devices late in 2018 and
then more available as we get into 2019. If you saw just last week, the FCC approved our purchase of Straight Path and so we are excited about
moving that forward to close.

So as far as execution goes and POPs, we are placing the fiber that we need now, as we shared. And I know you were there in November. We shared
the number of incremental sites that you need over a densified 4G network is much smaller than we had expected. So we are not seeing the sort
of capital intensity that some were assuming.

So as you indicated, we have announced Sacramento. We have three to five planned for the year. I am personally out meeting with some of the
mayors, talking about what we are going to be providing. And the reception has been extremely positive.

So as you know, it takes a little while to work through the city governments and get these things approved, but Sacramento is a terrific model for
us. We continue to build that partnership. And I wouldn't suspect it will be too much longer before you will see the other cities announced and
then we can be more specific on POPs.

But as far as capital goes, Matt told you what our guidance was for the year. We are reallocating the capital that we have been spending. We don't
see any upward pressure of this in this year. And we will be able to determine the return on invested capital as we go through these trials and these
commercial launches and we will share more information as the year moves along.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley - Analyst

Great. Thank you very much.

Operator

John Hodulik, UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Thanks, guys. Either for Matt or for Lowell. Can you guys talk about the low-single-digit GAAP earnings guidance, which I assume includes Straight
Path and the $0.05 to $0.06 from the increase from the charitable contribution?

Talk about some of the underlying drivers of that. You have seen wireless EBITDA margins continue to move up; some pressure on the wireline
side. Is that what we can expect for 2018? And talk about how you see the competitive environment evolving in the wireless market that may
support continued increase in margins on that side. Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Yes, thanks, John. Good morning. So yes, in the guide, we talked about the low-single-digit GAAP earnings. And we talked about a few below-the-line
items in there.

Straight Path will be dilutive because we are largely paying for that transaction in shares. And you will see an uptick in D&A cost because of the
transactions we did last year.

But we are confident that the underlying earnings are improving. You are seeing that come through the service revenue on the wireless side of
the business. You saw that number improve to just a negative 2.9% in the fourth quarter.

And then we said on an apples-to-apples basis getting back to flat to positive by the middle part of the year. So excited that we have completed
that journey of transitioning the base and look forward to continuing to see wireless revenue growth from there.

Wireline I think in 2018 will be on a similar trajectory that you've seen in the past couple of years. Although as we continue to deploy more fiber in
the network, it gives us opportunities to replace some of those earnings that were on copper-based products with fiber-based products, which
will be more sustainable going forward. So net-net, you should certainly see an improvement in the earnings profile of the Company versus the
last couple of years.

And then you mentioned the charitable contribution in your comment. I want to be clear that the guide is before the impact of tax reform and
revenue recognition. And when we say before the impact of tax reform, we also mean the net impact of tax reform, which includes the contribution
to the foundation and the employee piece.

So the low-single-digit EPS guide is before that $0.05 to $0.06 impact of those couple of initiatives Lowell described, which is baked into that $0.55
to $0.65 positive impact from tax reform. So hopefully that gives you a little more clarity on the moving parts within there. But it's built off the
underlying earnings profile being stronger year over year.

John Hodulik - UBS - Analyst

Okay, thanks, Matt.

Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Thanks for taking the question. I have sort of two follow-ups here around the impact of tax reform. You talked a bit about how you are going to be
taking advantage of some of the benefits you are going to see.

I'm curious if we could expand on that. Do you see an opportunity to maybe reinvest some of the savings in your competitive behavior? Meaning,
we've had kind of a calm period here to end the year. You have invested a lot in your business.

Is there an opening here for you to maybe spend a bit more to get customers to revisit your network or even just to get your existing customers
to maybe to move into newer devices where they can take advantage of some of your network investments you've been making recently?

And then just also we're kind of hoping that at a broader corporate level you will see a lot of changes in behavior. You obviously have relationships
with large enterprises. I know it's early days, but in your discussions with them, are you seeing any green shoots that perhaps they will start increasing
investments in their businesses in ways that can maybe have a positive lateral implication for your enterprise services segment down the road?
Thanks.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Okay, well, let me start out, Brett, on that and then Matt can certainly add in. On the competitive front -- you've been around me for years. I have
said from 1983 when I got involved in telecom and wireless that it's an extremely competitive market. And the competition can come from different
places at different times, but it's always very strong.

Verizon has never been one to lead the market down from a price perspective and we are certainly not going to change that now. Our focus inside
the business is to use the assets that we have in our portfolio today, like Oath, to be competitive in ways that the others can't compete. And as we
roll 5G out, we see much more opportunity to be innovative as a way to be competitive versus using tax reform to just take our prices down.

Now, on your enterprise front, I think we have all been very pleased at how the market and the economy has run up here since tax reform. And
just like we are positioning ourselves to be able to execute and accelerate our strategies, I see other businesses doing the same thing.

And telecom is such an important part of the productivity measures of a lot of these enterprises, we do see the opportunity to pick this up. But
remember, we are only 30 days into the tax reform process. And we are all trying to understand the implications on what we can accelerate and
how we can accelerate.

So where we build our fiber, where we are deploying 5G, what enterprises are telling us they want to do with our intelligent edge network is
influencing where we put our capital dollars. And I expect this to continue and I expect to see things pick up.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs - Analyst

Great, thank you.

Operator

David Barden, Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a couple quick clarifications from Matt and one for Lowell. With Matt, so just following up on that EPS guide,
to be clear, the low-single-digit guidance does include the benefit from the change in the accounting for the handset-related selling costs. And --
just to clarify that.

And then the second on the cash flow guidance. The $3.5 billion to $4 billion cash flow benefit, is that a sequential year-over-year benefit or is that
a benefit relative to what you were expecting to pay in cash taxes in 2018?

And then Lowell, if I could just ask. You've done a number of things on fiber, both organic builds in terms of Boston, for instance, acquisitions of
XO, and then more creative partnerships like on the WOW front.

Can you talk a little about as we look into 2018, 2019 the path forward on fiber infrastructure and supporting the 5G build? Is it more of an organic
game plan from here on out or are there still ways to make acquisitions on that front?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, David. So your second question to me, the cash flow guide, the $3.5 billion to $4 billion. That is compared to what our 2018 cash taxes
would have been without tax reform. So it's not a comparison against 2017's cash taxes; it's just the 2018 impact with and without tax reform.

On the EPS guide, maybe I will try saying this a little clearer. The EPS guide is our view on the business without revenue recognition and without
tax reform. So then you lay on top of that number the impact of revenue recognition that we gave in the 8-K last week. And you also lay on top the
$0.55 to $0.65 increase in EPS that I described in the prepared remarks earlier this morning. So hopefully that -- does that help clear up the EPS
question?

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Sorry, Matt. It was -- because the revenue recognition is one thing. But there is an expense recognition change that's a separate thing that's a benefit
between $900 million and $1.2 billion. And I was just wondering if that's included in the single digit or not included in the single digit?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

It is not included in the single digit. You add it on to the single-digit guidance.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Perfect. Thank you.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Okay, and then David, so your question kind of boils down to is it organic or is it M&A and where do we see deploying fiber. So just for everyone
else on the call, we have done some M&A. XO had a fair amount of fiber and WideOpenWest had fiber that we did by M&A.

But we also announced our deal with Corning, which is a multiyear deal where we are doing 12.5 million miles of fiber per year for the next 3 years.
So that would tell you we are sort of tilting toward organic.

And our priorities are really what can we do to get off of others' lease services to meet our 4G cell densification needs, then 5G, and then our
enterprise customers. We are out in markets now obviously placing fiber, but it's a market-by-market analysis of the three factors that I just talked
about.

And frankly, the cities, the meetings that we're having with the cities and what access they will give us to street furniture and conduit and those
sorts of things factor into the equation. So it's a bit fluid at this point. And I wouldn't tell you that if an opportunity came up to accelerate it through
M&A, we would do it.

But most of the fiber companies were built for different purposes. They were point-to-point enterprise sort of services and they don't fit the
architecture that we're building today, which is multiuse fiber for our intelligent edge network. So I hope that's clear enough for you. But certainly
leaning toward organic builds to meet Verizon needs to drive our costs down and our performance up.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst

Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.

Question for Matt as well as a question for Lowell. First, Matt, can you talk about the strength in wireless phone net adds in the fourth quarter in a
bit more detail? And can you also describe what you are seeing from two of the changes in the competitive market over the past 12 months, which
is cable starting to sell wireless subscriptions and also some of your competitors bundling in video services.

And Lowell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the vision at Verizon. As you look at what you are investing in the mobile
business, fiber infrastructure, 5G, is there a broader vision inside the Company that you want to provide broadband access to as many premises as
well as mobile customers across the country?

And is there some vision of what proportion of the country you may be able to reach in three to five years as you take all of these things together
that you are doing as a Company? Thanks.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Mike. So I will start off with the wireless phone question and Lowell can get onto fiber. Look, we had a great year on the wireless performance.
The net adds were very strong. As I mentioned, our smartphone net adds at 1.8 million for the year, up 34% year over year.

So we really saw a significant change the day we launched unlimited back in February of last year. And from that point forward, we have competed
very effectively in the marketplace. And it really allowed customers to have a similar currency to compare different carriers on and the value
proposition is resonating.

And despite all the noise that you hear from other people and the claims you hear from other people, the network quality matters. We saw that
numerous times throughout the year. And we see that in the performance we had on net adds, whether it be the new activations coming in or the
churn that we've had.

So each of the last three quarters of the year, phone churn was below 0.8%. And I think that tells you how much customers enjoy being on the
Verizon network.

So you ask about the MSOs. We are happy with what we've seen so far. Obviously, Comcast is on and Charter has said they expect to be on later
this year. And as we have said consistently, we like those agreements and we signed them in 2011 and we are happy to be doing them today and
we will see how they play out.

But everything we've seen so far is in line with our expectations. And we are glad to have that traffic on our network and monetizing that traffic
based on what those companies are doing with those agreements.

And in terms of what the competitors are doing, look, they've bundled a number of things into their services during the course of last year and our
numbers have stayed very consistent. So at the end of the day, the quality of the network that the device is on is of fundamental importance.

And overall, when you look at our value proposition, it continues to resonate strongly. And as I say, we are very happy with the results we had last
year and starting off 2018 on the front foot.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Okay, Mike, let me take where do we want to head from an infrastructure and a vision perspective. Look, I think it's very clear here whether you
look at what's going on today with customers or what you are anticipating that you saw at CES and others from what's next that there is an insatiable
demand for broadband.

And it's not mobile and it's not fixed. Customers don't care, and I think who wins is going to be able to provide them the service that they can move
seamlessly from fixed to mobile. We have been a much stronger mobile company over the years.

But the way we are positioning our fiber deployment and the way we are positioning 5G, we will be able to disregard geography and deploy those
broadband services at a much lower cost than we have ever seen at least during my career.

Now, for us, to complete the vision, you need to be able to provide the Internet information services. And video drives an awful lot of that. And
we've talked at length about taking the Oath assets to be that information source around news, sports, finance, and entertainment and lifestyle.
We think that the assets that we have will provide what customers need.

And you look at the applications going forward, whether it's medical and healthcare services, whether it's smart cities, whether it's education,
whether it's autonomous cars and transportation systems, you are going to need that sort of seamless high-bandwidth. And we lump that under
the title Humanability.

So our focus is around giving all of our customers the capabilities to embrace these applications of the future that are going to make their lives so
much better. So our investments, they are all about providing the assets and the platforms to deliver that.

Hi, good morning. A question about your capital budgeting process in the light of tax reform. Just given that the returns on a whole range of
projects will now have been boosted by both the lower tax rate and the accelerated depreciation, does that change your priorities with respect to
capital investment?

Or are there some specific types of projects, whether it's deploying fiber or that sort of thing, that now pop to the front of the queue as being
meaningfully more attractive than they were? And how should we think about that with respect to the total size of your capital budget going
forward?

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Well, Craig, I'll take that and then Matt can jump in. I guess you could accuse us of being boring, but you at least should give us credit for being
consistent. We have been extremely disciplined, and then when we see an opportunity we go hard. And you saw that in 3G, you saw that in 4G,
and you are going to see it and you are seeing it in 5G and placing fiber.

We see a real opportunity here. We were the ones that stood up and said two years ago when everybody said we were way too early, but we've
been deliberate about it. We have gone out, we have done the field trials, we have developed the ecosystem, we have worked with partners from
Korea as well as the infrastructure providers.

We are out there, as I said, with 200 cell sites today learning. And we are going to see what commercially happens in these three to five cities. Then
we will make the decision.

So to us, it's very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we are all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose
that discipline. What tax reform does do is gives us great flexibility that once we prove to ourselves that we can get a reasonable return on invested
capital, we can accelerate very rapidly. And that gets to Matt's point about we want to early on strengthen that balance sheet to give us the flexibility.

But the strategy is there. We are sort of like a spring ready to expand very quickly if we need to. But we have to get through another couple of
hurdles here before we make those decisions. And we are not ready to say that in January of 2018, but I certainly hope by fourth-quarter results
next year we are accelerating because we've got such a great story to tell.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

The only other thing I would add to that, Craig, and I kind of come back to the comments that Hans Vestberg made earlier this month. That in our
industry, the nature of the way that we spend money, having significant increases and decreases is inefficient in the way we deploy CapEx.

So we are certainly looking at, given, as you say tax reform, can change some of the return math. But we will be methodical about it. And there is
a lot of planning that goes into our capital spending before we get to it.

And so that's why you see us making the comments we do. We certainly look forward to having the right opportunities in front of us, but you will
see us do it methodically and do it in the way that creates the greatest value.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst

Thank you for taking the question. Two, if I may. One, the inevitable spectrum question. With T-Mobile's purchases and the broadcast auction they
have, I think two times the amount of low band spectrum. While you have a ton of millimeter wave spectrum, some naysayers might say that all
the eggs are in that basket. How do you think of that?

And then second, if I could get some math around David's question earlier. You mentioned moving away from leases. Can you quantify how much
right now you are paying in backhaul to some of the fiber providers?

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Why don't I take the spectrum question. As you say, Jennifer, the inevitable question. Look, there's going to be an awful lot of noise around
deployment of 5G.

If you recall back when we deployed 4G, there was a big scramble for everybody to try to get 3G to look like 4G. And we called it faux G, F-A-U-X,
and you are seeing some of the same stuff right now.

In order to do 5G -- and this is right out of the standard, which we certainly agree with -- you need at least 100 megahertz of bandwidth to provide
the latency, the reliability, the throughputs that really are the 5G promise. I can take 5G and I can put it on 10 megahertz of PCS if I want to. It won't
perform like 5G. It will be the technology, but it won't have the reliability, it won't have the throughput, and it won't have the latency.

So you are going to get a lot of this well, they need this or -- depending on whether you are selling spectrum or what you've got in your basket of
spectrum today. But I wouldn't change positions with anybody out there. I have got plenty of low band spectrum. That works great for 4G. It's
going to service for years to come.

But in order to put all of the aspects of 5G into play, you need hundreds of megahertz of bandwidth. The only one who has that in a big way in the
marketplace is us.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

So I will just add one other piece to that. I agree exactly what Lowell said about 5G. And as you think about 4G network, we've always said there's
three things: it's spectrum, it is the densification in the architecture, and then the technology.

And I can tell you over the past few months, there's been a number of technology upgrades to the network and you are seeing that in the network
performance. A number of those were deployed in the backend of the fourth quarter.

So significant amount of additional capacity being added to the network as we head into 2018. Again, without having to go acquire additional
spectrum. But I do expect you to ask that question on most calls going forward. It would be kind of amiss if people didn't.

In terms of your question on how much we pay in backhaul fiber, that's not a number we've disclosed. We really don't break out the income
statement by individual line items and we are not going to start doing that now. But I would just say as we think about fiber, we look at the most
economic way of getting it, irrespective of where it shows up in the financial statements. And we will continue to do that.

Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst

Amir Rozwadowski, Barclays.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thanks very much. Late last year, Lowell, you had highlighted a goal for $10 billion in cost cuts over the next few years. I was wondering how should
we think about the areas where you believe the biggest opportunities for cost reductions are? And how should we think about those cost cuts
filtering in through the Company over the next couple of years?

And then secondly, I was wondering if, going back to the 5G topic, if you can touch upon whether you believe that fiber will be a competitive
advantage in this world? Clearly you folks are making a significant amount of investment to get the necessary densification and capillarity that you
need for fiber. Others seem to be working with cable providers to improve densification and backhaul.

Do you believe that this is a viable alternative versus what you guys are doing? Or do you believe that at this point in time you are setting the stage
for a longer-term competitive moat as 5G comes to commercial positioning?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO

Thanks, Amir. Let me take the first one on the $10 billion number over the next 4 years that Lowell mentioned in September. And we've talked
about it a little since then.

Look, every area of the business is where we are looking and we believe that there's opportunities across every area of the business. Obviously,
network costs are a significant part; distribution is something we're taking a close look at. Customer care, all the back-office type activities.

Essentially there is no area of the business that isn't going to get examined as part of this exercise. Because it's imperative we make sure that we
are as efficient a Company as we can be as we go forward.

From a timing standpoint, I can tell you we've embedded the 2018 targets for this activity in each of the business units' operating plans for the
year. And I look forward to discussing the results that we achieve on this as we go forward in 2018 and into the future.

And then, Amir, I guess my answer on the fiber competitive advantage is throughout my career, I've always believed and it's been reinforced many
times that if you've got a critical component of your success, you better own it and control it.

And that fits with our direct distribution. It fits with a lot of our customer service. We don't outsource sales. We certainly wouldn't outsource critical
components of our network.

As Hans has come in and put in our architecture for intelligent edge, owning that fiber asset is important to our financial performance as well as
the performance of the network. And as we have seen time and time again, network competitive advantage drives customers, which ultimately
drives financials.

So you won't see us outsource much in the way of network unless someone has a huge scale advantage and we could negotiate very strong
performance and very consistent financials that would go along with it.

Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital - Analyst

Thank you very much for the incremental color.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

That's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Lowell for some closing comments.

Lowell McAdam - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman and CEO

Thanks, Brady. So just a couple of final points from me. I don't come on these calls very often. I like to save that for when we've got significant
changes in the business. And obviously tax reform and our use of those funds was important for us to clarify.

But there was a second reason for me to come on. And I have been in this industry for 30 years and I think we are breaking into one of the most
exciting times that I've seen in my career. We are on the cusp of what I call the Fourth Industrial Revolution as we see smart city applications, the
changes in medical, the changes in transportation and education. All of those are fueled by a strong telecommunications infrastructure. So I think
this is a great time for our industry overall.

Obviously, I think Verizon is the best positioned to deliver that future. We've had a long history of strong operational and financial performance.
We are investing in the media platforms and the fiber assets and the network and in the new technologies to meet the needs that are coming
forward. And I think, as I said, that will be a major change in the way people live, work, and play.

So I'm very excited about 2018, what lies ahead for us. I look forward to sharing the results and the successes as we move forward in this year. And
coming on a call next year at this time and recapping one of the best years in our history. So with that, we will close the call and we appreciate all
of your time today.

This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website.

The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted
as sequential. In addition to our comments today, on February 21, Verizon will be hosting an Investor Day event in New York City, and we will be
webcasting presentations by Hans and the leadership team. More information about this event will be posted on our IR website.

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $0.47 per
share and full year earnings of $3.76 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several special items that I would like to highlight.

JANUARY 29, 2019 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Our reported earnings for the fourth quarter included net pretax loss from special items of about $4.9 billion. This net loss consists of a previously
announced goodwill impairment for Oath of $4.6 billion, acquisition and integration charges of $189 million and severance and annual mark-to-market
for our pension and OPEB liabilities of $165 million.

In addition, we recognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion related to an internal reorganization of wireless legal entities. Excluding the effect
of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.12 in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax
reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was $0.90 in the fourth quarter, up 4.7% compared to
$0.86 a year ago.

On the same basis, for the full year, adjusted earnings per share, excluding tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, was
$3.87, up 3.5% compared to $3.74 a year ago.

It has now been a full year since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated in
the table on Slide 4. As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue, offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and
the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change was $0.09 per share in the fourth
quarter and $0.28 per share for the full year. The effect has been fairly consistent throughout 2018, with the fourth quarter slightly higher due to
seasonality in wireless volumes.

In 2019, we expect a smaller benefit from the adoption of the standard due to the deferral of commission costs. The reduction in benefit creates a
year-over-year EPS headwind, which is expected to be about half of the 2018 impact in each of 2019 and 2020.

For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted, financial results will exclude the impact of the revenue recognition accounting change to
provide clear comparability with prior periods.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2018.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning to everyone. This was truly a great year for Verizon. I'm so proud of our team and what they've accomplished
in 2018. As I've traveled around and met with our employees and loyal customers, I've seen first-hand the great work that they are doing in pioneering
solutions, focused on creating value and meeting customer needs.

We're on the forefront of technology and innovation as we provide our customers with fantastic experience on our networks. 2018 was a remarkable
year. We delivered solid financials, returned value to our shareholders and strengthened our balance sheet as we continue on our trajectory to
achieve a pre-Vodafone credit rating profile.

Our capital allocation remains disciplined and focused as we invest in our networks and put our board in a position to maintain our consistent
approach to the dividend.

Financially, on a like-for-like basis, 2018 was highlighted by strong wireless service revenue and earnings growth. This is a testament that Verizon
provided the best wireless experience on the nation's best network. Our bottom line performance was delivered through a combination of this
revenue growth and our business excellence initiatives, which drove cash savings across the company.

We widened our network leadership position in 2018 and continued our momentum in delivering solid financial and operational performance.
Our networks remain best-in-class and our performance is best than ever as evidenced by our recent wins from J.D. Power and RootMetrics.

We extended our lead in wireless performance as we enhanced our network and delivered a personalized experience for all our customers. 2018
was a year of 5G firsts. We were first to complete an over the air data transmission on the 5G global standards. We were first to complete the 5G

data session on a smartphone. And in October, we proudly were the first in the world to commercially deploy 5G with our 5G Home product. As
we finish the year, our confidence is high as we are heading to the 5G era and the beginning of what many sees as the fourth industrial revolution.

Operationally, we announced the vision for Verizon 2.0, which is the realignment of our operations to better focus on our customers. This new
operating model realigns our customer-facing units into consumer, business and Verizon Media Group. This will enable us to leverage our scale
and infrastructure to create better solutions for our customers.

We expect Verizon 2.0 will go live in the second quarter of 2019, and our results for the second quarter will be presented under the new structure.
This transformation in how we face our customers is matched with the transformation under our business excellence initiatives where we recently
announced our Voluntary Separation Program and plans for our IT outsourcing. Together, these initiatives, along with our Verizon 2.0 operating
model, position us to be even more competitive in a rapidly changing environment.

Now I will hand over to Matt to talk about the financial and operating results of the businesses starting with Slide 6. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Hans. In the fourth quarter, total operating revenue as reported was $34.3 billion, an improvement of 1%. And for the full year, 2018 revenue
was $130.9 billion. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, total revenue was $34.1 billion in 4Q, up 0.5%.

The 2018, on a comparable basis, excluding impacts from revenue recognition, divestitures and partial-year impacts from acquisitions in the media
group, adjusted operating revenues grew approximately 2.2%. The primary driver of the increase was continued wireless service revenue growth,
driven by step-ups in access and net account growth.

In the fourth quarter, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, totaled approximately $11.0 billion compared to $10.7 billion last
year.

For the full year, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, totaled approximately $45.6 billion, an increase of 3.1%. And consolidated
adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.9%, slightly lower than last year's margin of 35.0%.

Our business excellence initiatives produced cumulative cash savings of $2.3 billion in 2018.

For the full year, the mix of activities skewed more towards capital reductions than OpEx savings. The Voluntary Separation Program gives us a
good starting point for further benefits in 2019, and the program remains on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative savings for the
four year period.

Let's now turn to our cash flow results on Slide 7. In 2018, Verizon significantly strengthened the balance sheet with strong cash flow, while
continuing to efficiently invest for sustained network leadership. Full year cash flow from operations totaled $34.3 billion, up $10 billion year-over-year.

Year-over-year improvements in cash flow from operations was driven by strong operating results, recurring and nonrecurring tax reform benefits,
reduced headwinds from the wireless device payment model as well as lower discretionary pension and benefit contributions.

Full year capital expenditures was $16.7 billion, in line with our revised guided range of $16.6 billion to $17.0 billion. Free cash flow for the year
totaled $17.7 billion, up $10.6 billion year-over-year.

We ended the quarter with $113.1 billion of total debt, comprised of $103.0 billion of unsecured debt and $10.1 billion of device payment
securitizations. Our near-term unsecured bond maturities are modest at $2.6 billion for year-end 2020.

Total net debt was down $4.7 billion in 2018, and unsecured debt is lower by $5.2 billion. The reduction in unsecured debt and higher EBITDA were
the primary drivers in improving our net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA-ratio from 2.6x at the end of 2017 to 2.3x at the end of 2018.

JANUARY 29, 2019 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

In addition, the balance sheet is stronger as a result of about $5.1 billion of discretionary employee benefit funding during the last 2 years. This
was primarily related our pension plans, raising the funded status from approximately 70% at year-end 2016 to about 91% at year-end 2018 on a
GAAP basis.

The strength in balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to grow the business. We expect excess cash flow remaining after investing
in the business, and paying our dividend will be deployed in 2019 towards our balance sheet goals.

Now let's focus on the operating segments, starting with wireless on Slide 8. Our customized experiences within our Unlimited plans on the best
wireless network have created a strong value proposition, and this is resonating with consumers. New customers are coming to Verizon at higher
access points, and existing customers are stepping up in their plans. Additionally, we have seen our customers expand their accounts with more
lines throughout the year.

In the fourth quarter, total postpaid net adds were 1.2 million, up 3.9%, including phone net adds of 653,000, which were up 51.5% over last year's
strong results. In addition, we added 11,000 tablets and 556,000 other connected devices, predominantly wearables.

Smartphone net adds were 873,000, up 34.9% compared to 647,000 last year. For the quarter, we increased customer account, adding 118,000 to
our base. For the full year, postpaid net additions of 2.5 million included 1.1 million phones, 1.6 million other connected devices and 181,000 tablet
losses. Our competitiveness in 2018 was highlighted by smartphone net adds of 2 million, up 13% versus the prior year.

The overall experience of pairing our Unlimited plans with the Best Network continues to resonate with our customer base, resulting in outstanding
retail postpaid churn of 1.08% and phone churn of 0.82% in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, postpaid device activations totaled 11.9 million,
down from 12.4 million last year. About 81% of these activations were phones, with wearables accounting for the majority of the other device
activations. The reduction in activations with the net result of higher gross additions being more than offset by lower upgrades.

Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 6.3%, up sequentially as expected, but was lower compared to 7.2% for the same quarter last year. The
elongation of the upgrade cycle continues as more customers hold onto their devices for a longer period.

In the quarter, prepaid net losses were 90,000 compared to a net loss of 184,000 in the prior year. Our 4G smartphone prepaid base increased
during the quarter, and all of the decline in prepaid net additions was due to 3G and basic prepaid phones. We ended 2018 with 118 million total
retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 2.3% to 113.4 million, and
our prepaid connections totaled 4.6 million at the end of the year.

Let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless profitability. Our wireless operating results provided the basis for growth and profitability in
the fourth quarter. Total wireless operating revenue increased 2.1% to $24.3 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, operating revenue totaled
$91.3 billion, an increase of 4.4%.

For the quarter, wireless service revenue increased by 1.9%. For the full year 2018, service revenue grew 1.7%, attributed to ongoing customer
growth, step-ups to Unlimited and the benefits of subscribers customizing their experience through mix-and-match plans.

On a year-over-year basis, equipment revenue decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter due to lower upgrade volumes. For the full year, equipment
revenue increased 8.4%, driven by higher price handsets and increased sales of wearables.

At the end of the quarter, approximately 48% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance. Our postpaid
phone base on unsubsidized service pricing increased to about 84% at year-end versus 80% at the end of last year. The fourth quarter trends in
service revenue, business efficiencies and upgrade volumes provided the basis to EBITDA margin to increase year-over-year to 40.5% compared
to approximately 39.8% in the same period last year.

In the fourth quarter, we generated $9.8 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 3.9%. For the full year, we generated $40.9 billion of EBITDA, up by
approximately $2.3 billion year-over-year.

JANUARY 29, 2019 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Let's move next to our wireline segment on Slide 10. Total operating revenue for the wireline segment decreased 3.5% in the quarter and 3.1% for
the full year. Growth from our high-quality, fiber-based products continues to be offset by secular pressures from legacy technologies and
competition.

For the full year, consumer revenue decreased by 1.5%. Consumer Markets revenue decreased 1.0% in the quarter as Fios Internet growth was
overshadowed by declines in video and legacy products. Fios revenue grew by 2.5% in the quarter. This growth was primarily driven by an increase
in the total customer base and strong demand for higher Internet speeds.

In the quarter, we added 54,000 Fios Internet customers. We now have a total of about 6.1 million Fios Internet subscribers. In Fios Video, the
business faced ongoing headwinds, as observed throughout the linear TV market. The Fios Video business ended with 46,000 subscriber losses in
the quarter and 168,000 for the year. For the quarter, enterprise solutions revenue decreased 3.0%, partner solutions revenue decreased 9.2% and
business markets revenue is down 5.6%. Overall, secular and pricing pressures continue to be significant headwinds for these businesses. We expect
legacy product revenues to continue to decline in 2019 at rates consistent with last year. In order to counter this decline, we continue to invest in
fiber-based products and new applications that will open new opportunities for customers across our business lines. Through our One Fiber
initiative, we are building a single highly resilient and scalable fiber network that will allow us to efficiently provide advanced data services to
customers across our consumer, business and enterprise customer groups. As a result, we remain confident that we can continue to generate
growth and momentum in fiber-based products and new applications. Segment EBITDA margin was 16.9% for the quarter and 19.2% for the year,
as our focus and operational efficiencies was more than offset by revenue declines and content cost escalations. Let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss
our media and IoT businesses.

For the quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue was $2.1 billion, a decrease of approximately 5.8% year-over-year. As expected, revenue trends were
up sequentially from 3Q due to seasonal advertising spending. Year-over-year, we continue to see traction in growth in mobile usage. However,
this is overshadowed by the macro pressures from declines in desktop volumes. From a technology standpoint, we have now completed our supply
and demand side platform integrations. We are focused on technologies and resources in the business that will yield forward momentum. In our
telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $242 million. IoT revenues, including Verizon Connect, increased approximately 9.5% in
the quarter. Our value proposition is evolving as our engagement with municipalities gains more momentum with the upcoming commercial
rollout of 5G services.

Let's move next to discuss 2019. Our focus on executing on the fundamentals of the business positions us with strong performance in the upcoming
year. On a GAAP reported basis, we expect low single-digit percentage growth in full year 2019 consolidated revenue compared to the prior year,
driven by the continuation of wireless service revenue growth. We expect to see organic earnings growth in 2019. However, our EPS will be impacted
by the revenue recognition headwind we discussed earlier as well as a few nonoperational items, primarily a higher effective tax rate and increased
interest expense due to placing additional spectrum into service. After the effects of these items, which we expect to be approximately $0.24 to
$0.28 of pressure on EPS growth, we expect our adjusted EPS in 2019 to be approximately the same as our adjusted 2018 EPS, excluding the impact
of the new lease accounting standard.

At this point, we expect the adoption of the new lease accounting standard to have about a $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter headwind impact on EPS
in 2019.

The 2019 effective tax rate is projected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. We expect cash income taxes to be $2 billion to $3 billion higher due to
tax benefits that were realized in 2018 that we do not expect to repeat this year.

Our internal capital and decision process and return objectives have not changed. We are consistent and methodical in our allocation. We expect
consolidated capital spending to be between $17 billion and $18 billion, including the expanded commercial launch of 5G. This capital intensity
is consistent with historic levels.

Let me now turn it back to Hans to walk through our strategic priorities for 2019.

JANUARY 29, 2019 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

Thanks, Matt. Verizon's strategic priorities for 2019 are clear. I have outlined 5 priorities with my team that focus on our customers, financial
performance, 5G leadership our valued employees and Verizon's role in creating benefits for our society.

First, we will redouble our long-standing excellence in customer satisfaction. This customer-centric mentality has always been one of our core
assets and will become even more essential as innovation continues to accelerate. Second, we will build on the momentum of our strong 2018
financial and operating results. Today, we're growing the business, strengthening the balance sheet and improving the cost structure to compete
in any environment. In the future, we will enable and monetize new use cases on our advanced networks. Our third priority is to extend our
leadership in 5G. The cornerstone of our strategy continues to be our best-in-class network. We have demonstrated our network leadership through
every cycle from analog to 4G. We run to and embrace the challenge of deploying the best technology for our customers. Whatever the technology
is, such as small cells, dense fiber or LTE Advanced features, Verizon has the proven track record of setting the gold standard for others to follow.
In return, our consistent investment in our networks, particularly in 5G, will pay dividends as we advance and lead the industry into the fourth
Industrial revolution.

Not too long ago, the mere thought of having a 5G network before the beginning of the next decade would have seemed implausible, but we
pushed the industry to get there faster. As a leader and catalyst of change, we advanced 5G development and delivered to the world the first true
5G deployment in 2018 with our initial 4 commercial markets, and this is real 5G. This is a completely transformative experience that gives customers
speeds measuring hundreds of megabits to gigabits, reduced latency, allows for connection per square kilometers by millions and energy efficiency
at a fraction of today's consumption.

Our 5G network is predicated on delivering a game-changing wireless experience. The assets we have compiled and put into place in 2018 have
enabled this vision. We have the spectrum to provide rich ultra-wide band 5G services. Our deep fiber backbone connects our assets, enabling a
high capacity and efficient architecture. Our investment in the intelligent Edge network creates new capabilities and gives us flexibility to serve
our customers, and it is our engineers and the know-how they have accumulated through this development process that binds our 5G solution
together.

No other wireless operator has this unique combination of assets. We are the leader in 5G, as we have said before, and proven once again. We don't
wait for the future, we build it.

Our fourth priority is our employees. Our winning team with the new Verizon 2.0 will be the key to creating new solutions in today's world. We
want to continue to foster an organization environment that embraces change, sparks curiosity and encourages strategic risk-taking while inspiring
all of us.

Internally, our shared purpose is to deliver the promise of a digital world by enabling people, businesses and society to innovate and drive positive
change. Our fifth priority is carrying forward Verizon's commitment to responsible business practices and making the world a better place. At
Verizon, we've coined a word, "humanability" which means the power of technology to create new abilities for humans to innovate and drive
positive change in the world.

I'm confident that Verizon's 5G network will be a universal enabler of advanced use cases and technologies that brings humanability forward. I'm
super excited to host our upcoming investor day on February 21. We will bring the Verizon executive team and go deeper into our strategy, our
vision of Verizon 2.0 and our enhanced customer focus. With that, I will turn back to Brady for the Q&A session.

Brady Connor

Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to questions.

JANUARY 29, 2019 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2018 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Hans, I wonder if you could give us an update on 5G Home. When do you expect the standards-based gear to be available? And what does the
CapEx guidance really imply in terms of homes passed this year and the progress towards the 30 million? And then any commentary on the handset
outlook for mobile 5G and what we should expect on that side this year?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

Thank you, Simon. When it comes to the 5G Home, we are so far, fully deployed in the 4 cities that we decided for. So what we're waiting for right
now is the CP equipment for 5G Home. And as the industry is evolving, the first focus for the industry is actually to do chipset for smartphones.
And then secondary, the next generation of chipsets comes on the CP side. We definitely believe that this year, we will get CPs on the NR standard
in the second half of 2019. So that's where we are, and we are building the network as we're speaking. And as soon as we see the availability of this
CPs, we will, of course, start getting that out in the marketplace. And that, of course, subsequently answers the question on handset as well. We're
going to see handsets coming out in the first half of 2019. We have -- as you know, we have announced 2 phones, 1 from Motorola and 1 from
Samsung. The one from Samsung has not been seen yet, but hopefully, it will be seen soon and as soon as those are ready. And we have been
together to build interoperability, testing that to where we're going to launch that. And remember now that the network is a multiuse network.
So the home and the mobility is the same network we're building. We're not building 2 different networks. So it's more multiple devices you're
connecting to the network. So -- and then, ultimately, on the question on CapEx, I think Matt guided our CapEx, which has been consistent over
the years. We are doing everything. I remember the majority of investments in the 5G network is coming with the fiber that we have been doing,
the passive asset we are doing, the Intelligent Edge Network design that we've been working on for years. And then, of course, you have the
equipment coming at the total end of it. So we are actually -- been for several years investing and to be prepared for the 5G, and this is including
in the CapEx guidance for this year for obvious reasons.

Operator

The next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Maybe a couple quick questions for Matt. On the wireless side, you saw ARPA decline a little bit in the fourth quarter versus the growth in the third
quarter, and you saw a decel in the service revenue growth. What's driving that decline that we saw this quarter? And are the sort of benefits of
moving to the Unlimited sort of fully reflected in the decline we're seeing? And how do you expect that to trend going forward? And then on the
free cash flow, thanks for the CapEx and the taxes guidance, any other sort of things we should be thinking about as we look to free cash flow in
'19 from a pension contribution or working capital standpoint?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, John. So on the wireless service revenue, I think as you look at the fourth quarter number, what we have is we continue to have good
underlying momentum in the wireless service revenue, whether you're talking about the total service revenue line or whether you're looking at
the ARPU line. But there is a little bit of noise in the fourth quarter number that masked that growth. So let me just give you a little more detail. In
4Q, both in '17 and '18, we had some nonrecurring items that gives us that 1.9% year-over-year increase, which, as you say, is slightly lower than
the past 2 quarters but still certainly a good positive number. 4Q in '17, we had a positive adjustment related to our wholesale revenue, and that

adjustment didn't repeat this year. So we're lacking that adjustment. Additionally, this year, we had a couple of items go the other direction,
including some service credits related to that we granted customers impacted by natural disasters. So when you compare those, you remove those,
the underlying core retail postpaid service revenue increased sequentially, had good momentum year-over-year, in line with what we saw in 2Q
and 3Q. And importantly, we start 2019 billing more accounts at a higher ARPA than we've started last year. So it's a good place to be. I think we
continue to see opportunity to increase service revenue in 2019 by adding accounts as we did last year, but also increasing ARPA. There's still
significant headroom for us to move customers to Unlimited and step them up when they're in Unlimited, adding more devices to accounts. So I
think the momentum we saw in '18 will certainly continue into '19 in a good way. On the free cash flow, so we don't actually provide, as you know,
a free cash flow guide for the year. We did talk about the fact cash taxes will be higher. As I think about cash flow for 2019, there's 5 major items I
would think about, a couple of them in the positive direction. We certainly expect the core EBITDA of the business to increase year-over-year.
Additionally, last year, we have $1.7 billion of pension and benefits contributions that we would not expect to be at the same level in 2019. In the
other work direction, I mentioned in the prepared comments the higher cash taxes. We'll also have the payments related to the voluntary severance
program. All of that cash outflow will be in 2019, and we do expect CapEx to be higher slightly year-over-year, too. So when you net those items
together, you can kind of get to a view for 2019 cash flow. But certainly, cash flow in 2018, very strong, $34 billion, up $10 billion year-over-year.
We're proud of the progress we made there, and we'll certainly look to build on that in 2019.

Operator

The next question will come from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Two, if I can. How should we think about wireless EBITDA in 2019, given your continued cost focus, and a comment that 2018 cost savings were
more focused on CapEx than OpEx? And second on the balance sheet, I wouldn't let you get away without talking about leverage, 2.3x today and
headed lower. Can you think a little bit for us about priorities for cash flow from here? Do you see buying assets like spectrum or fiber that could
lever you back up? Or should we start thinking about capital return in the next couple of years?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Phil. I'll start with the second one there on the balance sheet. So as you say, good progress on the leverage ratio and the net debt to EBITDA
from 2.6x to 2.3x during the year. And as I think about heading into 2019, our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. We'll continue to be
disciplined in how we deploy capital. Our #1 priority is investing in the business, whether that be CapEx or whether that be other ways we can
invest in the business. After that, we certainly -- the dividend continues to be very important to our shareholders. And then as we've said, we
continue to strengthen the balance sheet. In addition to the reduction in the leverage ratio, I'd also point out in the past couple of years, we've
made approximately $5 billion in contributions to our pension and benefit plans. And so our funded status on our pension plans from the last
couple of years has gone up from approximately 70% to 90%. So some really good progress there. We'll see how the year plays out. We certainly
expect to continue to improve strength in the balance sheet, and we'll also look for opportunities to grow the business. And if there's still cash left
over, we'll decide what to do at that point in time. In terms of the wireless EBITDA in 2019, look, I would start at the top of the income statement,
and we expect service revenue to continue to grow. So that's the tailwind that we have coming out of 2018 that we'll build on as we get into next
year. So we'll have some growth there. And then as we continue to focus on the cost side of the business, obviously, we've got 10,000 people
leaving the business over the course of the next few months that will have a positive impact on the EBITDA. And we continue to look for other
ways to continuously make our business more efficient and competitive. So I think you should see some good EBITDA trajectory as we go through
2019, and that will help contribute to the cash flow, as we've talked about.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

And I can only add that on the question about CapEx and OpEx in '18, we had more cash savings on the CapEx. We will continue with our disciplined
way of the business excellence program, both on CapEx and OpEx. And I think that in '18, we showed that we did everything we wanted to do on

CapEx. At the same time, we actually became more efficient. And I think the program we have put in place is very eager and very good. And that
brings us all our benefits that we need to get from the investments at the same time as we're getting efficiency. So that's very much part of it, but
we'll also look very much with the top line, as Matt talked about. I think it's a combination and with the new leadership team that are coming into
the second quarter. I think we're going to have a great focus on it.

The next question will come from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

If you don't mind, I was hoping maybe you can clarify some of the comments you made around the EPS guidance and some of the drivers. So you
basically kept saying that you expect earnings, exclusive of the new lease accounting, to be similar or effectively flat this year. And I think you
indicated that there's essentially about a $0.14 headwind from the ASC 606. You had a $0.28 benefit in '18. I think that goes to about $0.14 this
year. And I just want to clarify, I think you also indicated there's another, say, $0.10 to $0.14 coming out of the higher tax rate and the increase in
interest expense because of putting spectrum into the service. So all in, those items are $0.24 to $0.28. Is that the point you made?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Good morning, Brett. Exactly. So yes, you heard the guide right, on a GAAP basis, prior to the lease accounting, roughly similar. And you're
right, the --- within there -- and we've talked about this, I think, on the third quarter call, you have this headwind from 606. And that's $0.28. So the
benefit in 2018, we said roughly half going the other way in '19. So you're right, that's around $0.14, and then a couple of other items below the
line that we've talked about in the prepared comments. So as we deploy the AWS-3, we're capitalizing less of our interest expense. So that creates
a year-over-year headwind. It doesn't change the cash flows of the business one bit. And then the -- on the ETR, we have the same guided range
this year as last year, 24% to 26%. Last year, we ended up at 24.2%. We had a number of nonrecurring items that had us at that lower end of the
range. Going into the year, we don't necessarily have line of sight to the same amount of nonrecurring items this year. So at this point, we're
planning on being closer to the middle point of that range, and we'll see how that plays out. But as you say, when you add those up, you've got
about $0.24 to $0.28 of headwinds. And so that means you have operational year-over-year improvements of a similar amount that get you to that
guide. So I think what you see over the past couple of years here, Brett, is certainly, in '16 and '17, we had a business that was pretty flat at the
revenue and earnings line. And then in '18, when you adjust out for the impact of tax reform and 606, we had a 3.5% increase in EPS, and that was
even with some headwinds in there from the checkout dilution from Straight Path and a couple of other items. So good EPS growth in the core
business in '18 and then you see us building on that in '19. And we tried to provide a little more commentary in the prepared remarks, so you can
get the flavor of it and get some of the puts and takes that get us to the overall guide. But certainly, it's based off of the core underlying business
continuing to grow year-over-year.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

And if you don't mind, just a quick follow-up. You walked through the wireless components that are driving that core growth. What have you
assumed for Oath in your outlook for 2019 that were Verizon Media services? I believe it was dilutive to earnings in '18. What are you assuming the
impact will be this year?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Verizon Media Group, certainly, we talked a lot about in the second half of last year. We didn't provide a breakout of earnings. I'm not going
to now. But certainly, when you see a negative 6.9% revenue growth in 3Q and negative 5.8% in 4Q, it wasn't as much of a contributor to earnings
as much as we would have liked to have been last year. The assumption, as we head into this year, is that we'll make progress on the revenue line.
And as they make progress on improving that revenue trajectory, it certainly will have a -- will change the earnings side as well. But -- so we would

expect the -- they've got some good plans in the business. We now need to execute against those, get the revenue trajectory turned around, and
that will then impact earnings in a positive way as well.

Operator

Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

I guess, a couple for Matt. You're focusing on the wireline side, Matt, kind of pros and cons. We saw a little bit of an uptick in enterprise. We saw a
big step down in wholesale, and margins really kind of came off in that division. And I'm wondering if that's going to be kind of a focus for the
Voluntary Separation Program that you've undertaken, and that's -- we're going to see some of that. So if you can kind of walk us through the
drivers on the wireline side. The second question is just for the sake of kind of thinking about 2019. Where are we going to see the IFRS 16 lease
accounting changes kind of have an effect on the business on the income statement? That'd be helpful.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, David. So on the wireline side, and I'll ask Hans to add a couple of comments as well around it. But certainly, the ongoing secular decline
in some of the legacy technologies, that continues. What's encouraging in the business, so -- is as we build out our fiber assets and the opportunities,
that creates there some of the incremental technologies we're deploying in the area like SD-WAN. We're seeing some good progress to offset those
secular declines. So we will continue with that. And then as you rightly say, as you think about the margins as you head into '19, wireline will see
a good part of the benefit from the Voluntary Severance Program. So that, in addition to the other ongoing cost actions that we continue to take,
should be of assistance to the wireline margins in '19.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

Yes. And if you look at the whole wireline team, as you rightfully pointed out. I mean, we have a secular decline in certain areas there but -- we also
see -- with the assets we are now bringing out with Intelligent Edge Network, we see a possibility for many new solutions sort of coming out of our
customers based on the fiber we're deploying. But also, when it comes to SD-WAN and a couple of other very important solutions that we're
bringing out, at the same time, the small and medium sized segment's very important for the U.S. economy, where we are well positioned. The
wholesale has, of course, come down a little bit. But remember now, we are deploying more infrastructure than ever before. So I think that over
time, but it will take some time, we will definitely see even more possibility there. We have a very strong focus on that team to actually break the
trend, and we have now been coming down for -- when it comes to growth. I think the team is really focused on getting new products out, and
we have a really good customer base throughout the wireline base. And as we move into the second quarter and our customer-centric organization,
it will even be more important with these customers that we can work straight with all our product portfolio from wireline, wireless, the IoT business,
et cetera. So I think we're really focused on coming back to growth. At the same time, you see that we're taking out costs, so we see that we're
managing that. So again, we have a surgical focus on actually top line, but at the same time seeing that we're managing our cost basis at the same
time. And I think that Matt and the team are on to that operation all the time, and we will continue so in 2019.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the lease accounting, David, so a couple of different things. On the income statement, as you heard upfront, we expect $0.01 to $0.02 of
headwind per quarter. That's going to come mostly above the line. There may be some initial adjustments that'll hit below the line, but mostly
above the line. If you think about it, there's some costs, upfront costs associated with leases that we historically would have capitalized under the
old rules that we won't necessarily be able to capitalize all of those rules -- all of those upfront costs under the new rules. So that's where you'll see
some of the change come through. From a balance sheet standpoint, we will be grossing up both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet

in -- at this point, we expect in the $21 billion to $23 billion range. So that's the impact you should see come through in the first quarter of 2019
from adopting that new standard.

Operator

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

I wonder if we could just stay with the discussion of wireline for a second. Matt, when you were talking in your prepared remarks, you talked about
pressure from programming costs. I wonder if you could just think about kind of the Fios Video business for a moment. It seems like you've been
hitting on some of the same themes for a while now, and that it may be right for sort of reimagining what you do with that business. Can you just
talk about your strategic thinking about how long does it make sense to stay committed to a linear video product for Fios versus certain repositioning
it along with your 5G product as really almost a pure connectivity service focused on broadband?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Craig. So, as you say, a number of the trends we've seen in wireline have been ongoing for a number of years, including the increase
in content cost. So we continue to look for creating different options for customers that make sense for the price points you can then put in front
of customers. And so -- but we don't expect the trajectory of content cost to change significantly over the next few years unless we take some
actions. And if we have the opportunity to provide customers with different ways of getting to the video content they want, we will certainly be
excited about doing that. So look, ever since we did Choice TV about 4 years ago now, we've been looking at ways to give customers better choice
around the cost of getting their video product, and we'll continue to do that.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

No, and I agree with Matt there. We will, of course, over time, see that we can create the optionality for our customer to choose between different
solutions for their TV viewing. So we will have that definitely in our pocket. Initially, of course, 5G Home has been focused on other cities than our
footprint for Fios. But ultimately, we will see that our customers have all the choices when it comes to how they want to consume their video. I will
see the trends in the market. And as Matt said, we are working hard with our cost in the Fios business all the way from content to other cost elements
to see that we're managing that well. But ultimately, we need to create optionality for our customers that what Verizon all has set down, and that
we'll continue to do.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

I guess, if I just -- if I was going to paraphrase, it sounds like you still believe that the linear video product is still helpful in your ability to market Fios
broadband and that Fios broadband is not more competitive on its own as a broadband-only product?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

No. I think that first of all, we're going to manage our customers and see that they are getting what they want. I mean -- and we're going to follow
the market very closely. But we still have plenty of customers using our Fios business on the linear TV, and we will continue to serve them if they
think that's important. But at the same time, we're going to create optionality, and that's the job that we have as a tech innovator to constantly
innovate and bring new solutions to our customers as the markets are evolving. So we were going to see that the ones having Fios they are getting
that. We have upgraded our Fios technology during 2018 and 2017 after a while of holding back a little bit. You'll also see that the ones that our

customers that feel that is good service, they are getting more of the service as well. So we will continue with that, but at the same time, create
optionality over time. That's what we will do.

The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD and U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Just a couple, if I could. First, going back to the comment for expanded commercial launch of 5G in 2019, can you frame how much of the country
Verizon will cover for mobile 5G by the end of '19 and maybe also by the end of 2020? And then secondly, can you quantify the specific potential
earnings benefit from the Voluntary Separation Program once it fully rolls through the financials?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

Okay. If I start with the 5G, I mean, we have not disclosed where we are on the deployment. I can say we're deploying as fast as we can. And much
of the work that we have been doing in the last couple of years is, of course, to prepare everything from the fiber to the agreement with the cities
to get the Intelligent Edge Network from the transport network, core network all out to the access. As the industry matures, the equipment is
maturing for NR, so we can bring that in. And we actually have quite a lot of deployment already of those types of ready-base stations. So we will
come back to that when we commercially launch that. What we have noted, there's nothing we want to disclose for competitive reasons. So I won't
talk about it right now. But I think what is important to understand is the lead that Verizon has on 5G. But we have been on to this for several years,
including the millimeter wave, where already our commercial service, where we, of course, not only understand the engineering of the 5G technology
and the spectrum, it's also all the way from operations, marketing, installation, all of that. And that is extremely valuable insight when we want to
go fast as soon as we see that we have all the pieces that is needed for launching 5G Home or 5G mobility with the ecosystem there and all of that.
So again, we have triggered the industry to be probably 1.5 to 2 years ahead of the schedule of 5G. We think that is enormously important for
Verizon to be on the forefront of innovation. And we're going to push that. As I said, we're -- nothing holding back after coming out to 5G, it's more
that we need to see that the ecosystem is equally ready as Verizon is right now.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Mike, on the voluntary benefits, so as we announced 10,000 people coming off payroll, in terms of the benefit this year, they come off in predominantly
3 different waves. Some came off at year-end, and we've got a couple of additional waves coming off. So that factors in. We'll have a small amount
of backfills, not for exactly the same positions, but as we reimagine the work. But net, net, a significant -- down the vast majority of that 10,000. So
the timing at which people come off will matter. Remember, the charge we took was $1.8 billion. We haven't disclosed what we expect the income
statement benefit in 2019 will be, but certainly, we expect to get a good payback on that initial cost of doing the severance. So you should expect
a pretty significant benefit in 2019. And as we continue to change the way the work gets done, those heads don't come back into the business,
and that should be a sustainable cost improvement as we go forward.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

And I just want to put it into context. I mean, remember, we started with a lot of transformation in the network. And by that, you have the new --
a lot of new ways of working. Then secondly, on top of that, we also defined a new way of working with the right team, where we have a fairly large
outsourcing ongoing. At the same time, we have the voluntary program. All in all, it's our way to prepare ourself for the future to be even more
efficient, so that we can be even more agile in the future. And you saw also last week, I guess. We had announced also that we're doing a work in
the Verizon Media Group, where we out there are reducing. And all in all, it's part of a large transformation for us to prepare doing that when we
are as strong as we are right now. So we're actually coming out there when the competitor landscape continues to be around than what's happening.
We're going to be agile and much more quick on the investments, et cetera. So I think it's a larger transformational dividend launch in the third

part of that transformation, of course, the Verizon 2.0 that we are implementing in the second quarter in order to have much more customer-centric
solutions for our customers. And that's based on our assets when it comes to the network, our brand, and our distribution and seeing that we're
excelling in this marketplace. So that -- so you need to put all that in the context when you think about what we're doing right now. And I think
I've been here now for quite a while. I mean, I see the response of the organization be very positive to all the change and to see that we continue
to be the leader in this market.

Operator

The next question is from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director

Just 2 brief ones, if I could. First, have you seen any signs of impact in the business from either a slowing macro backdrop or the government
shutdown earlier this month that we should consider? And then, secondly, on the wireless competitive landscape, can you just talk about what
you saw in the marketplace in 4Q and whether anything has really changed materially thus far in January?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

Yes. Matt, so on your first question, no major impact at this point on the macro economy or even the shutdown. On the shutdown, we did see some
impact in our government business, as you would expect, but nothing significant to the overall business. And then in the wireless market, we see
a continuation of the trends that we saw in 2018. The vast majority of the promotions now are more on the handset side, the hardware as opposed
to on the service revenue. We continue to see that promotional activity in the marketplace, but we continue to believe that -- and see the evidence
with the great network experience and having the right offers where we compete effectively. And I would reiterate what we said earlier. When you
talk about that Best Network experience, when you look at a number of the third-party surveys that came out for the second half of 2018 performance,
not only did our performance improve, but we widened the lead against the competition. So that continues to matter to our customers and put
us in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners.

Michael McCormack - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Telecommunications Senior Analyst

Maybe just circling back on the wireline side. The enterprise decline seemed to be a little bit more muted this quarter. Was there some sort of CP
benefit that you got or anything else going on, on the enterprise side? And then secondly, on the competitive front, I guess, both in wireless and
wireline, any change from the recent launches in cable? I know we have Charter launching wireless. And in the broadband side obviously rolling
gigabit services across the footprint, any change that you're seeing across both of those segments?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

Well, the enterprise decline, there was nothing special from that. It was also a normal mix, and of course we had some good wins in the quarter,
but it was nothing from the CP that was sticking out. On the MVNO, I mean, I can only comment that we're happy with the agreements we have. I
mean, we -- for us, with the technology and the network we have, I mean, it makes sense to work with MVNOs. And I think that we are very happy
with the setup that we have with the 2 cable guys right now in the market.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

No, exactly. I think the -- nothing we saw changed significantly in fourth quarter from the trends we discussed previously in the year in terms of
the makeup of competitors in the marketplace. And look, as the supposed gig footprints expand, it doesn't seem to be impacting our competitiveness.
It's also -- we continue to believe by having the best product out there is resonating with customers, and we welcome the other guys into the
market and look forward to competing with them.

Brady Connor

This is all the time we have for questions today. Before we end the call, I want to turn it back over to Hans for a few closing comments.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO

Thank you, Brad. And I'll just summarize up a little bit what we have been 'discussing. I mean, first of all, we have a strong financial operating
performance in the fourth quarter, but not only that, the whole 2018. I think the wireless team has built the momentum all the way from Unlimited
launch. I have to say I'm proud of the team that continues to innovate and as Matt has said several times on this call, that gives us a very good start
for 2019, what they have been doing so far this year.

So we are coming in with -- in 2019 with good momentum, both from a business point of view, but also our business excellence work we are
continuing to doing. And we are in the start of it. And I think that both Matt and I, we will do it in the best way and in a cautious way, but also
prepare ourselves for the future to be an even stronger company.

I've outlined my 5 key priorities. You heard them, and I think that they should be resonated with all of you, both from the growth point of view,
implementing the new structure, the 5G and, of course, our asset in our employees, and continue also to see that our brand evolves and that we're
doing the right thing for our society. I think that goes for any company in today's world where employees, customers and shareholders are expecting
it from you. And I think that's our normal strategy. So it's nothing new, but it's more that we need to continue to leverage that in our humanability.

We will continue to focus on innovation and our network. There's no debate that, that is extremely important to us. And I'm proud of what the
team did in the engineering in the network, on the 4G network. It continues to lead and extend the leadership, which I think is a great contribution
to the skill set we have in our technology group. And that, of course, continue in the 5G, which we have already our 5G Home commercial. We want
to see much more of 5G commercial, both Mobility and Home during 2019. And I hope that you are equally excited as I am, and I hope that you
will join us for the Investor Day in February. We're going to bring the executive team there. You're going to meet the new leaders. We're going to
go a little bit deeper on the things we're discussing today in the structure, what we're doing. And of course, we want to talk about 5G.

So with that, thank you for the time today, and great that you're listening. Thank you very much.

Brady Connor

Thanks, everyone.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

As a reminder, we're in the middle of a millimeter wave spectrum auction, so we will not be able to comment on our current millimeter wave
spectrum holdings or strategy.

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.23 per share,
resulting in full year earnings of $4.65 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a net pretax loss from special items of
approximately $2.4 billion, including an early debt extinguishment charge of $2.1 billion; an impairment charge of $236 million, primarily related
to the write-down of goodwill within our media business; and a net charge related to severance and annual mark-to-market for our pension and
OPEB liabilities of $135 million. In addition, we recorded a $2.2 billion tax benefit related to the sale of preferred shares in a foreign affiliate. The
cash impact related to the tax benefit of this sale will be realized in 2020. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share
was $1.13 in the fourth quarter, up 0.9% compared to $1.12 a year ago. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $4.81, up 2.1% compared to $4.71
a year ago.

Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting
standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition and ASC 842 for leases continued throughout 2019. As we illustrated in previous quarters, we realized
a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 in 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction
of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue
throughout 2020. The impact was $0.03 for the fourth quarter and $0.12 for the full year. For 2020, we expect the headwinds from the deferral of
commission expense to be approximately $0.09.

In addition to ASC 606, accounting standard ASC 842 for leases, which was implemented at the beginning of 2019, results in a gross up on the
balance sheet for all operating leases. This new leasing standard affects our earnings per share primarily due to the expensing of certain upfront
lease costs, creating a headwind of $0.01 in the fourth quarter and $0.05 for the full year. We do not expect a year-over-year impact from the lease
standard in 2020.

Full year adjusted EPS growth of 2.1%, illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide, reflects strong underlying performance of the business, partially
offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense and the adoption of the leasing standard. Additional details of our quarterly performance
will be covered by Matt later in this call.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2019 and a discussion of our strategic priorities for 2020.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and thank you, everyone, for joining this fourth quarter earnings call. Let me summarize quickly a little bit everything we have
done in 2019, which is building a great fundamental for 2020. The transformation is built on a network, process changes, brand changes, go-to-market
changes, and of course, also a lot of new talent coming into our team. All that we're doing during 2019.

We've fortified our network with new architecture. We had a lot of process changes with the voluntary program. We rebranded and put one 
brand for everything we're doing in the company. We made a new go to market, including new management teams. That has been a big change 
in the company that is solidifying our way of accessing the market in an even better way in 2020. So all that's happening, we continue to actually 
execute well on our day-to-day business.

Our network continues to be the best in the market. We just had new confirmation from J.D. Power RootMetrics that, again, our network, our 4G
network is clearly the best in the market. Very happy with the team that they keep up that work.

The other thing that we have been very focused on is, of course, to continue to lead the market in wireless and -- for consumers. And here, we're 
seeing Ronan Dunne and his team continue with a good pace since the Unlimited came out with new offerings, seeing that our customer getting 
optionality, optionality when it comes to the wireless offering, but also on the cable side within mix and match that we came out with earlier this 
year.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We also added in a lot of partnership as we now have network as a service as a strategy. We added in the Apple Music, and more lately, of 
course, we included with Disney+. Both of them has been a win-win for both our partners, for our customers and for Verizon. And this is the 
strategy we want to have going forward.

On the business side, we also did a lot of important partnerships where we had the same model. I think about the partnership with, for example,
AWS Amazon on the 5G mobile edge compute, again, a totally new way of accessing a market that we have not been into.

And speaking about 5G, we had our commitment, 30 cities. We made 31. We said we're going to launch 5G Home with the NR standard. We did
that, and we said we're going to launch the first 5G mobile edge compute. We did that in Chicago in December. So all in all, a year with so much
execution, and at the same time, continue to achieve what we want to do.

And we round that up with our financials and the year-end operational metrics. I'm really happy to report that we had our best year since 2013 
when it comes to phone net adds, a growth of 28% year-over-year. And again, that is how our team has been working with the new model.

And on the financial side, we continue to see that we had a good wireless service revenue over the year with 3.2% for the full year, which is the
highest since 2014. And when it comes to our profitability, our EPS was up 2.1% within 2019 for the full year. And we continue to create strong
cash flow, which is, of course, giving us the flexibility going forward to see that we can execute on our strategy. Ultimately, consumer group
continued to have a very good year in 2019 with everything they're doing. The Verizon business group have, of course, the headwinds when it
comes to the secular decline in the Wireline side at the same time as we're investing more in that area. We're investing in processes, tools and
structures. And why is that important? It's so important because this is one of the greatest opportunities for growth for us when it comes to 5G and
how we address the market. And I can tell you, during 2019, I met so many large corporations that we now can actually work with because our
offering is so strong when it comes to fiber and 5G. But we need to put that structure in place for the Verizon business group in order for them to
actually both execute on the revenue side, but also on the cost side. And that's really what we're focused on.

Ultimately, I think we have created a very strong fundamental for going into 2020. And if you think about our priorities for 2020, first of all, continue
to grow on the core business. I mean, we showed this year we can continue to grow 4G and our core businesses, and that we'll continue to do in
2020 as well, including building our network to be the best network in this market.

Secondly is leveraging our new assets that we're building. We're building one fiber. We're building our 5G and seeing that we can start 
leveraging that with our customer. And I think that this year, we'll continue to have a lot of focus on our 5G build and what we're doing in 5G, 
and we will come back to that later on how we see the 5G market when we will have an Investor Day later in February.

So the third priority in 2020 is around our financials and our discipline there. And the ambition is to accelerate the growth in revenue and EPS in
2020 and continue to create strong cash flow as we did in 2019. But it's also to continue to have the discipline and efficiency in our CapEx and OpEx
spend. That's very important because this is really driving us going forward being able to execute on our strategy.

And the 4 priority is around our customer centricity and our purpose-driven company, both are very important to engage with all our stakeholders, 
if it's the society, our employees or customers, to have that in our genes in the company every day. Here, we will drive a lot around thinking about 
the customers, giving them optionality as we did in 2019, we will just continue to do that.

And when it comes to our responsibility to drive a responsible business, we laid out a lot of things in 2019, what we want to do, and combine our
responsibility of our society with our strategy. We think that is strengthening us, as a company, to all our stakeholders. And ultimately, that will
create even more value for all our stakeholders. So all in all, I think we have a really good platform coming into 2020. We are excited for it, and we
hope that all of you are excited for 2020 as well.

So by that, I hand over to Matt.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. We will begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results. In the fourth quarter,
consolidated operating revenue was $34.8 billion, up 1.4%. Service revenue remains the primary driver of growth, driven by volumes and step-ups
in access, partially offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and secular declines in revenue from our wireline products and services predominantly
in our business segment. At the beginning of the year, we provided consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage revenue growth
for 2019.

For the year, total revenue grew 0.8%, including a 3.1% decline in wireless equipment revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.1 billion as compared 
to $11.6 billion last year. The headwinds mentioned earlier from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard lowered 
EBITDA by $239 million, which is approximately a 70 basis point impact on EBITDA margin in the quarter. These results reflect continued strong 
margin performance in consumer despite a meaningful increase in volumes and secular weakness in the wireline portion of the business segment. 
Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.2 billion, and EBITDA margin was 35.8%, slightly lower than last year's margin of 36.2%.

Full year adjusted EBITDA included headwinds of approximately 70 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting
standard, which overshadowed our improved operational performance in 2019.

Through our Business Excellence program, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $5.7 billion and are on track to achieve our goal of $10
billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021. The Voluntary Separation Program resulted in approximately $1.3 billion of expense savings this year,
and we have been at our full run rate of savings for the last 2 quarters of the year.

Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.13, up 0.9% from $1.12 a year ago. We achieved our 2019 goal of low single-digit growth by posting a
full year adjusted EPS of $4.81, representing a yearly growth rate of 2.1%, including the $0.17 headwind related to ASC 606 and 842 that Brady
mentioned earlier.

Let's now turn to cash flow results on Slide 8. We had strong cash flows in 2019, which allowed us to continue our focus on investing in our networks,
increasing our dividend for the 13th straight year and strengthen the balance sheet. The year-over-year increase in CFFO was due to operational
improvements and lower discretionary employee benefit contributions, partially offset by higher cash tax payments and payments related to the
Voluntary Separation Program.

Capital expenditures for 2019 totaled $17.9 billion and well within our guided range of $17 billion to $18 billion. Capital spending for the year was
driven primarily by our fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside of our ILEC footprint and the build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network.
Additionally, we continue to support growth in data and video traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network and the upgrade to our Intelligent
Edge Network architecture.

Free cash flow for the year was $17.8 billion, up 0.7% year-over-year. Our balance sheet continued to strengthen with our net unsecured debt down
$3.7 billion year-over-year. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio rounds down to 2.0x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x. We
remain focused on reducing our secured debt portfolio into our targeted range while continuing to actively manage our near-term maturities,
optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our cost of capital. As part of this management of the balance sheet, we conducted liability
management transactions in the quarter and throughout the year, which will reduce our interest expense going forward.

Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 9. Our Consumer segment entered the fourth quarter with strong 
momentum. The combination of the new mix and match pricing, attractive device promotions, our award-winning network and the new Disney+ 
partnership drove continued success in the fourth quarter amid a competitive holiday season. We are extremely pleased with the early uptake on 
Disney+ and the ability to partner with an iconic consumer brand and content company to bring even greater value to our unlimited customers. 
As a result, fourth quarter phone gross adds were up 9.3% year-over-year, and postpaid phone net adds were 588,000, up 12.6% year-over-
year. Phone churn of 0.83% was up 6 basis points from a year ago, consistent with our expectations and reflect the elevated competitive 
activity across the industry. A breakdown of our postpaid net additions is provided on this slide.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Total postpaid device activations were flat from prior year at 9.5 million, including 7.9 million phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 6.3%, 
down from 6.6% a year ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle. Fios Internet net additions of 35,000 were up 
sequentially and down year-over-year. Our customers see value in our high-quality broadband offering, paired with multiple choices for video, 
such as Fios TV, YouTube TV and Disney+. Fios Video net losses for the quarter totaled 51,000. Earlier this month, we launched Mix & Match for Fios, 
providing customers with choice, transparency and the opportunity to only pay for the services they want.

Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the consumer financial performance. We continue to see growth in consumer operating revenues through 
our updated service offerings in Wireless and Fios, which were offset by modest declines in wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in 
copper-based wireline services. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $24.2 billion and for the full year were $91.1 billion, 
which were up 2.0% and 1.4%, respectively. We are utilizing tools such as pricing and partnerships to add to our value proposition and drive further 
increases in wireless service revenue and ARPA. Customers recognize the value of being connected to the best network in order to consume 
services or operate new devices. As customers require additional data, we seek to drive step-ups to unlimited plans from metered plans, step-
ups within unlimited to higher tier plans and increasing connections per account.

Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.4 billion, a 1.9% increase and $53.8 billion for the full year. We expect to see further 
subscriber growth as we continue to effectively compete in the marketplace and from continued migrations to unlimited as approximately 50%
of our customer base is still on metered data plans. In the fourth quarter, Consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 2.1% as pressure 
from promotional offerings and lower upgrade volumes more than offset the increase in phone gross adds. For the full year, equipment revenue 
decreased 4.4%, driven primarily by lower upgrade volumes.

Consumer Fios revenue remained relatively flat due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings, offsetting the impact of reductions in
video subscribers. Consumer segment EBITDA margin was 39.9% in the quarter, down 130 basis points from last year, including headwinds of
approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard. For the full year, EBITDA margins were
44.3%, including headwinds of approximately 85 basis points. The consumer segment demonstrated in 2019 that it can increase customer volumes
while continuing to produce strong margins.

Now let's move to our business segment on Slide 11. Business wireless trends remained strong throughout the year. Fourth quarter phone gross
adds were up 10.5% from the prior year primarily with the small and medium business and public sector, contributing to postpaid phone net adds
of 202,000, which were up 54.2% from the prior year. A breakdown of our postpaid net additions is provided on this slide.

Our continued strong customer loyalty across the business segment led to phone churn of 1% in the quarter, which was up 2 basis points sequentially
and down 7 basis points over the prior year. Total postpaid device activations in the quarter were up 7.1% over the prior year, while our retail
postpaid upgrade rate was 5% versus 5.3% in the prior year.

Let's now move to Slide 12 to review our business financial performance. Operating revenues for the business segment in the fourth quarter were
up approximately 1% over the prior year. Wireless revenue growth of 8.4% was partially offset by wireline product revenue declines. Wireless service
revenue grew 7%, driven primarily by small and medium business customers. From a customer group perspective, small and medium business
revenue increased 7.9% over the prior year, driven by wireless service revenue growth of more than 11% and double-digit Fios growth, partially
offset by ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services. Global enterprise revenues declined 1.6%, driven by legacy wireline pricing pressure
and technology shifts. Public sector and other revenue decreased 1.6% as growth in wireless products and services was offset by wireline declines.

Wholesale revenues declined by 10.6%, driven by price compression and volume declines in legacy wireline products, which we expect to continue.
Business segment EBITDA margin was 20.7% in the quarter, down 260 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 50 basis
points from the deferral of commission expense in the lease accounting standard. The reductions in margins year-over-year are due to the growth
in wireless activations, reductions in wireline revenues and the investments we are making in the business, such as the launch of our business-ready
marketing campaign and the transformation of our go-to-market processes.

Now let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued to make good progress in the quarter. Total revenue
was $2.1 billion, which was essentially flat versus the prior year, a meaningful improvement from the decline reported at the beginning of the year.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

While we have more work to do, we are very pleased with the results and the foundation we are building for future growth. Native advertising and
our demand-side platform continued to gain traction, mitigating the ongoing declines in legacy desktop search revenue streams.

Let's now move to Slide 14, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we close out 2019, we are providing a reconciliation
to legacy 1.0 results for the last time. The charts on this slide reconcile revenue and EBITDA from our consumer and business segments back to
wireless and wireline. The top chart shows consumer revenues of $24.2 billion in the quarter. After removing consumer wireline and adding back
business wireless, we had total wireless revenues of $25.3 billion with EBITDA margin of 41.0%. The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation
from business to wireline results, starting with business revenue of $8.1 billion and arriving at total wireline revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter,
down 4.1% from the prior year.

EBITDA margins were 11.9%, down from 17.6% last year. The factors impacting wireline margins are largely the same as those highlighted in the
business segment, most notably, the ongoing pressure from legacy wireline product revenue declines and the investments to drive future growth.
You can find additional detail in our supplemental information included on our website.

Let's now move to Slide 15 to discuss the wireless results. Total wireless operating revenues increased 3.5% and to $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter, 
driven by a 2.7% increase in service revenue and benefits from the total mobile protection pricing action taken in the third quarter. The fourth 
quarter performance was below our targeted range, primarily as a result of higher base optimization into new pricing plans, which we believe is 
stabilizing; and the impact of increased gross adds on our promotional expense that amortized through service revenue.

For the full year, wireless service revenue grew 3.2%, driven by retail postpaid ARPA growth of 2.5% and a 27.8% increase in phone net adds. Total 
wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 41.0%. This includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points, 
primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard. We are proud of this result, particularly given the strong 
volumes driven in the quarter.

Continuing the momentum from the third quarter, phone gross adds were up 9.6% to 3.1 million. Postpaid phone net adds for the quarter was
790,000, which were up from 653,000 a year ago, marking our highest fourth quarter phone net add performance in the last 6 years. Postpaid
smartphone net additions in the quarter were 969,000, up 11% from the prior year. Postpaid phone churn of 0.86% was up from 0.82% last year,
while total retail postpaid churn of 1.13% was up 5 basis points year-over-year.

For the quarter, we increased customer net accounts by 30,000. Total postpaid device activations were up 1.2%. This was a result of a 6% increase
in postpaid gross additions from the prior year to 5.1 million, offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate to 6.0% from 6.3% a year ago.

Now let's focus on our outlook for 2020 on Slide 16. We exited the year with great momentum, reflected by strong wireless volumes in both our
consumer and business segments, which, together with our focus on execution, positions us for accelerated growth in 2020. For 2020, we expect
low- to mid-single-digit percentage growth in consolidated revenue compared to the prior year. Included in this outlook are continued growth
and momentum in wireless service revenue trends within both the consumer and business segments and an expected increase in equipment
revenue as we expand the availability and reach of our 5G network.

For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings growth of 2% to 4%, driven by recurring service and other revenue growth in both consumer 
and business as well as ongoing cost initiatives. Adjusted earnings growth includes the impact of deferred commission expense as well as investments 
within Verizon business group in product development, continued process improvement and new work tools that would not only drive cost 
savings but create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5G, One Fiber and MEC. We expect to see cost benefits of this work begin to 
materialize in the back end of 2020 and increase in 2021, with revenue benefits starting in 2022.

We are excited about the future opportunities in our business segment and believe revenue and margins will expand in the future.

Below the line, we expect depreciation and amortization to be similar to 2019. Interest expense is expected to decline due to lower debt balances 
and the impact of our liability management last year. We expect each quarter in 2020 to be below the fourth quarter 2019 expense level. Adjusted 
effective tax rate is guided between 23% and 25%, in line with the actual results from the prior 2 years.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We expect consolidated capital spending to be between $17 billion and $18 billion, including the expansion of our 5G network in new and existing
markets; additional 4G densification to stay ahead of demand and our ongoing fiber build; our capital spending guidance results in our capital
intensity continuing within our normal range, although the timing will be higher earlier in the year than last year. In summary, we expect to build
on our strong financial performance and are positioned for accelerated growth in 2020.

Now let's take a look at capital allocation. Our capital allocation process is disciplined and focused. Priorities for the upcoming year remain investing 
in the business, continuing our commitment to the dividend and managing our balance sheet to achieve our targeted leverage range. With our 
leverage near the high end of the target range and expectations for EBITDA growth and healthy free cash flow in 2020, we are pleased to add share 
repurchases as a fourth priority of our capital allocation policy. Repurchases will begin after the other priorities have been met, including 
investment in our 5G rollout, potential spectrum purchases and the increased investment in the business segment, as highlighted earlier. Our 
earnings growth outlook for 2020 excludes the benefit from any potential share repurchases.

Summing up, in 2019, we demonstrated that we can improve service revenue and grow the company from a position of strength, we drove 
increased volumes throughout the year, utilizing updated unlimited offerings, effective promotional strategies and partnerships, positioning the 
company for sustainable growth. Our 5G built right strategy offers new opportunities to drive further growth as we continue to strengthen our 
network leadership. Importantly, we achieved strong results while expanding our industry-leading margins as adjusted for accounting impacts 
during a period in which additional competitors entered our industry.

Though we continue to face challenges within our legacy products and services, we are making strategic investments to drive growth in the coming
years. In addition, we continue to make progress in our media group, and we believe we have the necessary assets and appropriate strategy to
drive further improvements.

Execution is a key focus within Verizon, and we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, delivering on our commitment to strengthen 
our balance sheet. In short, we enter 2020 with strong momentum, poised to deliver growth and innovation.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady, so we can get to your questions.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Matt. Brad, ready to take questions now.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

The principal variance in your fourth quarter results versus ours and I think most people's expectations was the higher level of spending in the
business P&L, and it looks it's on the wireline P&L. And during your remarks, you talked about a step-up investments in the business Services
segment to drive growth in the future. So I'm assuming that we've already started to see that in the fourth quarter run rate.

I guess what I was hoping to get more clarity on is what precisely are you spending that on? I mean, if I annualize that uptick, it's well in excess of
$1 billion of incremental OpEx. So I think there's going to be a lot of interest in where you're spending it and how we should expect that payoff to
flow through.

And then to the flip side of that is, the annual EPS guidance you gave for this year, it looks pretty close to what most people are looking for, including
us, so there must be an offset and that would imply you're getting better operating leverage somewhere in your wireless business. And so I was
hoping you can maybe just walk through where the cost performance and the margin improvement is coming from on wireless as you look into
2020.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So Brett, I can start and -- so when it comes to the business group, you're right. I mean, we had already impacts in the fourth quarter on our 
investment that we're doing in the business group. Matt mentioned some of them. If I go deeper, I mean, as we are now approaching the market 
with a full portfolio for our enterprise customers, small and medium customers, we need to get all our billing system, all our tools behind CRM, et 
cetera, actually, working in a customer dimension. And this hasn't been invested in before, and we just need to invest there. And that's why you 
see also in the guide that you say yourself, we're staying basically on your line of expectation. That means that at the end of the year, we will see 
impact of those sort of investments and then they're going to roll off. So part of these investments are, of course, one-timers investments we're 
doing and then it will go away because we just need to fix a couple of things in order to address the market in the right way.

Secondly, the secular decline in wireline business, that is continuing. So that is sort of a little bit more sustainable. But that's why in the remarks on
that, we said also that in '21, we'll see even more impact of the cost reductions we're doing, and then the revenue impact will start gradually coming
'21, '22 in this side. But all in all, we're very excited about the opportunities that Verizon business group have because that's why we started building
the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network some 3, 4 years ago in order to actually address this market in the best way, and the traction we are seeing
with our customers is really good.

But on your first question, if there is some impact in the fourth quarter, the answer is yes. Matt, anything to add?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Brett, thanks for the question. So we certainly saw the uptick in spending, as Hans discussed. We feel very strongly about the opportunities in
VBG even more so today than we did when we announced a new operating structure. But some parts of that business haven't been a focus of our
investment over the years, so we're excited about the future ahead there.

You mentioned a kind of annualized run rate of $1 billion, and that's certainly not the number that we have in mind for that investment in 2020.
So I think that's significantly overstating where the 2020 number will be. But if you go back to the comments earlier, we did say that we would
expect to see an impact on margins in 2020, in line with what we saw in the second half of '19. I would expect we'll start to see the benefits of the
transformation activities on the cost side of the business around the back end of the year really impacting 2021 in a more significant fashion and
then getting into '22 and beyond on the revenue side. But look, we -- I think the underlying thing here is the level of confidence that we have that
over time, by making these investments, we can grow both revenue and margins within the business segment. So that's what we're focused on.

You also asked about the total margin structure of the company. If you've got this additional cost, the earnings guide would suggest there's some
other things offsetting it in the other direction. I think it starts with revenue. When you continue to have strong service revenue growth in both
consumer and business on the wireless side and some of the other revenue lines that we mentioned, that gives you a good starting point for
earnings growth. When you combine that with our ongoing cost activities and then even with the investment we're making in VBG, I would expect
to see upside to earnings through the year as a result of that.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV 
Analyst

Okay. Maybe for Matt, on service revenue growth, came in a little bit lighter than we expected here in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little
bit more detail on sort of the drivers there, especially in light of the better-than-expected subs? And it also looked like consumer wholesale wireless
revenues were sort of flattish sequentially. Was there any kind of reset this quarter in the sort of wholesale rate, especially given the growth in
subscribers in some of your MVNO customers?

And then lastly, any commentary, looking out to '20, on service revenue growth year-over-year would be great.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, John. Look, for service revenue growth in the fourth quarter at 2.7% for wireless as a whole, as you say, was a little below the guide that 
we had. A couple of reasons for that, and both of them actually speak to the value that we're creating with our customers. The first is, we actually 
saw the people who had the opportunity to optimize by moving to the new pricing structure that we launched in August, actually moved a little 
faster than we initially anticipated. And so we think that's actually now complete and behind us earlier than we expected, might see a little bit 
of an impact in the first half of '20, but certainly got more of it behind us in '19.

And then the other piece is a little bit of accounting noise in the service revenue line. A number of our -- part of our handset costs from a promo
standpoint get capitalized and amortized against service revenue. So when you have the increase in volumes that we had in 3Q and 4Q where we
had gross adds, we're up around 10% year-over-year in both quarters. What that means is we're starting to see an increase in that promo amortization
coming against the service revenue line. That will be a little bit of a headwind in the first half of 2020 as well until that reaches kind of a plateau
level in terms of the impact. But certainly, as you think about service revenue at the end of the year, the trajectory of the business, having the net
add growth that we had, we feel very strong about another good year of service revenue ahead of us. And as we mentioned, net adds, the highest
number that we've had for 6 years. So the wireless business is performing well in both consumer and in business and we expect that to continue.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

So I can only add on to Matt, that, of course, this is part of our strategy. I mean, since the launch of unlimited, we have constantly sort of developed 
our model to see that our customer can enjoy different type of packages in the mix and match, but we also had a very clear strategy. You see that 
our metered customers can be able to go up to unlimited, and that's why we made that move in August. And I mean, we see the payoffs here 
with the net adds. We roughly have, today, 50-50, metered and unlimited. So we see that the continuation of putting more value in the packages 
and seeing that we can actually get the journey for our customer coming into the unlimited is extremely good. And that's as a growth engine for 
us, and you have seen that in the second quarter -- or the second half of '19. So we have more to do here, but I think that the whole team of Ronan 
Dunne, et cetera, they are thinking about this. But also, don't forget, business side with Tami that have done a really good job with the wireless 
customers as well. So we're really encouraged when we see what we have done in the -- in our offerings and how that has responded well with 
the market. So we're happy with what we have seen in the last half year-end and give us encouragement for 2020.

The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan.

Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

You put up a big CapEx number at the end of the year and guided to the similar $17 billion to $18 billion. Can you talk about any shifts within the
CapEx priorities for 2020 versus '19 in terms of either fiber versus wireless mix or any shift within the fiber build in terms of the types of locations
or deployments you plan to do?

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

And when should we think about you starting to really monetize that fiber build?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. As you saw that we had a strong CapEx coming into the fourth quarter, at the moment, I'm really happy about it. You can see that our pace is 
coming up here quite dramatically in what we're investing in right now. And the interesting thing is, of course, that since we launched the Verizon 
Intelligent Edge Network, we have constantly found a lot of efficiency in our CapEx build, and that, of course, is giving us possibilities to continue 
to do more and more. So I think that our technology department have no constraints on what they need to do in 2020. This is what they have plans 
for in order for us to continue to fortify our 4G network, to continue with strong additions in the 5G as well as continue with our fiber build. And 
when it comes to the monetization of the fiber build, we're already starting to do that. Of course, because many of the fibers right now are going 
to our cell sites on air because that was a part of it. Then, of course, it has come a little bit later in monetization for our small and medium 
businesses and enterprise business, et cetera. But clearly, we're already now seeing the benefits of doing that.

So going into 2020, I think we have a very solid capital allocation for our CapEx. Matt and the team have worked with the technology team, and 
we are improving every year how we do this work. And of course, it's a lot of reallocation inside that $17 to $18. And if we go back 3 years, it's 
a dramatic change how we spend because of the new design on the network, but also the technology evolutions.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So on the monetization of the fiber, as Hans mentioned, it's a multiuse network. But you're already starting to see the impact, and I'll give an
example. And I think some of our network folks have mentioned this publicly in the past few months. You go back to the first quarter of last year,
and the majority of our new cell sites were going up on third-party fiber, you get into the fourth quarter of last year in the 60-plus markets that --
where we're adding fiber. It's now -- a significant majority is going up on our own fiber. So that will have a significant beneficial -- significant benefit
on, you'd think, our expenses going forward. And then as we continue to go, we'll add other monetization opportunities over the course of the
next couple of years. So I'd say, we're already starting to see the benefits of the fiber build in our income statement.

Operator

The next question from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

I guess, 2 questions, if I could. First, just with respect to kind of the back part of the year, I think that there's a degree of anxiety about the level of
competition that might emerge in the market around 5G and around the possibility of a 5G iPhone launch and how the various carriers are going
to market and kind of position themselves as network to go to for it. So if you could kind of give us a little color on kind of how you see the second
half of the year playing out with this potential 5G iPhones' super cycle emerging.

And then the second would be I just wanted to have you guys maybe address, there's an organization called Opensignal that has shared some 
data with the sell-side and others that kind of suggests that there's a handful of markets that Verizon's very stressed in terms of their spectrum 
allocations. And I think that, that's raised kind of questions about what Verizon spectrum strategy and network management strategy is going to 
be as we kind of bump into some of these limitations. So I just want to have you guys address that, if you could.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. On the first question there. I mean, Ronan Dunne already said in the beginning of the year that we're going to have some 20 5G devices
coming out in the market this year. So of course, we're going to see more 5G devices coming out. It's going to be more build in the markets in 2020
than we had last year. So of course, this is a year that there is going to be even more 5G things coming in.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

When it comes to any particular phones coming out in the market, we cannot really comment on it because that, we'll leave to the company to do.
But in general, of course, if this is a market which has a high degree of iOS, that means that when a 5G phone will come out from Apple, that will
be important for many consumers to look into what they think is a good change.

In our case, I think we're building a unique 5G experience with our millimeter wave that nobody else is building and have the capability to do. So 
I think that's really where the difference will come. I mean, we already have the best 4G network as you have seen in the latest J.D. Power and 
RootMetrics. We're going to continue to have that. So we're going to give the best experience to our customers. And we -- and I'm confident that 
how we are building the network will make a big difference. And that's why we also feel very confident if -- with all these devices coming out, 
including if the iPhone would come out, that we will have a good chance to actually grab more customers that want to be on our network.

When it comes to the spectrum and all of that, I mean, I think that I might have talked about this so many times. I mean, one thing is, of course, 
that we, first of all, have all the assets to deploy our 5G strategy when it comes to millimeter wave and using dynamic spectrum sharing, be able to do 
nationwide when our customers are ready. So I think that's clear.

I think that another thing that is very clear that spectrum is not the only thing that is needed to do a great network. Think about what I have seen. 
I worked with 400 carriers around the world in my life. It is a lot of carriers, have a lot of spectrum. They don't have a great network. I mean, they 
don't use it in the right way. I came to this company because this company is the best in the world how to deal with data. Everything from spectrum 
to how you densify networks and what type of software you put in, and that's a long-term planning how to do that right. And I think that's something 
where you -- or people around us go wrong when I look at us because think about how we have been performing, and many actually thought that 
we would never sustain in unlimited. And to be honest, the network is growing, we're getting more and more headroom as we're continuing 
deploying our software and the engineering capabilities we have in the company. So again, we feel good about the position we have. Of 
course, as we all know, there might come out, the C-band. And we're, of course, encouraged about the FCC's plan of doing that. We think the C-
band is an important spectrum for many reasons. I mean, first of all, it's one of the global spectrums, that frequency will be global. So roaming 
will be done on it, and that's very important for U.S. market to get into that. And it's very important for Verizon to get into that. So I think -- 
but it's not hindering our strategy right now to deploy a great 5G network and be able to capture the market on 5G.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

I'll just add one comment on that, David, on that piece. I mean, our engineers took a look at that report yesterday, and they said there's so much
missing in terms of their planning. They have line of sight to meet our needs for many years to come. And so I think I would put money on our
engineering team every day of the week, and their track record is second to none. So we're very, very confident that we have the spectrum we
need to continue to grow the business.

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Great. On spectrum, maybe you could just comment on CBRS. Obviously, there's an auction coming up, how do you see that fitting into your plans?
And then on 5G Home, you haven't talked a whole lot about it. With the CPE coming, is that still second half of the year? What are your expectations
for what we should see in 2020?

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. On the CBRS, as you know, we have already started for quite a long time ago to do trials and see how it works, and it works fine. We 
think it's a good addition to the portfolio that in order to see that we get good customer expectations. So we think CBRS is an important spectrum, 
even though it is sort of more shared than anything else, but it's going to be definitely something we're using as it comes out.

Secondly, when it comes to the 5G Home, I mean, you're confirming, actually what we have in front of us. The next-generation chipset that goes 
into the CPE for 5G Home will come out. At least, the plan right now is in third quarter, which means that commercial product is probably 
coming out a little bit later because it takes some time from the chipset to the device. By then, we will have, of course, deployed far more 
millimeter wave across the country, so we will be able to start launching many more markets when that happens. So that will come back to a 
little bit more about that when have our Investor Day the 13th of February, talk a little bit more about it. But that's in the grand scheme, the 
plans for 5G Home, and that's no different from what we said half a year ago.

Operator

This question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

Can you share any early results? I know it's very early days, but of your mix and match video offer? And it's hard to miss that with your mix and
match video offer for Fios that the customer is seemingly far better off to choose the YouTube TV option to save a lot of money. Is that the intention?
And why not make the step to say that's our only video offer and you really focus the business on the Fios broadband connectivity where it would
seem you have a much better story to tell?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. I think when it comes to the mix and match, we want to give our customers optionality on top of the broadband. If it's the fiber broadband 
or if it's the 5G Home broadband, we want to give them optionality. Of course, one optionality is always to have a broadband and having over-the-top 
services. But another is, of course, giving the mix and match optionality right now to see that they use the right packages that is more fitted for 
them. Still, of course, it's what they can choose whatever channels you have because they come in packages. But the early -- or early indication is, 
of course, that customers that has been on trial for a month, they clearly see what channels they're using and what package we can suggest for 
them, that is going to be more optimized.

So I think for us, we just think about our customers and where the market is going, and we want to give them the optionality of actually having 
different ways they can address the market when it comes to their content consumptions. And I think it's good for our customer experience, but 
it's also good for our customers because all of them can do it. So as you said, it's a little bit early, but I think that our customers are very happy that 
we're giving them this optionality. And I think this is, of course, what everyone see where the market is going, meaning more and more over-the-top 
content is coming in and you want -- you need to start mixing and matching that. And here, we have a great opportunity given our network 
as a service strategy, and we can work with all the type of optionality in the content market as we're not owning any content.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD and U.S. Telecoms Analyst

A couple of follow up questions. First, with the revenue guidance range of low to mid-single digits for 2020. Can you frame the flex points as to
what would drive revenue growth to the higher end of the range relative to the lower end of the range?

And then second, with respect to the fiber expansion, can you just also frame for us just the total amount of fiber you're trying to go after over a
3- to 5-year period to help us put into context what the current deployment activity means for the company's longer-term goals.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. So let me start with the revenue guide and unpack that a little bit for you. So as you think about how would you get from 0.8% this
year to low to mid-single digits next year, if I go through the individual pieces, they're obviously within consumer. It's a continuation of service
revenue trajectory that you've seen so far, the other revenue line as well. And then within business, again, continuation of those service revenue
trends. They're very, very strong. We don't see those slowing down anytime soon. So that will be better.

A little bit of improvement on the wireline side within business, but nothing significant. And then even within media, you think about that being 
down 3% on a full year basis in '19, but getting back to about flat in the fourth quarter, so less of a headwind of revenue from media in '20 than 
'19.

Within the total number, the 0.8% last year, wireless equipment was negative 3.1%. We don't expect that number to be negative in 2020. But
obviously, that is the biggest wildcard within the overall revenue guide as we think about it in terms of knowing exactly what we see, primarily in
the second half of the year as you get into the holiday season and iconic launches and the like. So -- but we feel optimistic about the revenue
growth going forward here, really building on the momentum that we've built across both consumer and business over the course of the past
couple of years and feel pretty good about that guide as a result.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

On the fiber side, I mean, I think, first of all, I mean, we said it in -- a couple of times during '19. We're starting to get on the level of sort of activity 
per month and quarter right now that we were planning from the beginning. It took us some 2 years to get up to that pace. The team is really 
good at it right now. We can get much more scalability around it the way we're doing it. Remember also, we always do the trade-off between 
owning and leasing or sharing with someone, and that is a very prudent or financially disciplined way of looking at our deployment. In many cases, 
we see it as owning it has really an advantage for us because of the multiuse of our network. Now we're doing sites all the time. We're going to 
create revenue for our business side. So we probably have a couple of years left on doing that. But in general, I feel good about the pace we have 
right now and the multiuse of the fiber we have. And I think this is one of the most critical assets in a network today -- in today's world, especially 
as we build Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and you want actually to start delivering the 5G experience that we're expecting. We need this fiber 
to be there. So that's basically where we are with the fiber.

Operator

The next question from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

With 5G, I think the coverage is going to be very important also, and I think you're using dynamic spectrum selection for that. Can you just talk
about how that's going and the timing? And then just kind of further on 5G, maybe just some color on what you're thinking, how much further
ahead you are than your peers? And maybe lastly, any other use cases that you're seeing talking to either enterprise customers or consumer
customers for 5G for both coverage and density?

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. On the DSS, the dynamic spectrum sharing, as you have seen some PR, we have done. We have already gotten this to work from the 
software point of view. And the majority of our baseband is ready for taking DSS. So what we have said, I'm not going to give you an exact 
date, but I'm going to tell you, we're going to be ready when we feel the market is ready and our customers need to have that coverage.

And again, remember, we want to have the best network performance-wise. We don't want to deploy it because it's called 5G. We want to see that 
we actually give a superior performance to our customers. And that's why we think that the millimeter wave, what we're doing there is extremely 
important because we talked about 10 to 20x, at least more throughput and speed than we have on the 4G network, and we still have the best 4G 
network. So I think that's what we already assessed. When we meet at the Investor Day, we're going to talk a little bit more about the technology, 
et cetera. We'll get a little bit more in-depth around that.

When it comes to the 5G and where we are, I think that you saw last year that we had a strong deployment coming in during '19, but of course, we
have even higher ambitions in '20. And we will also come back and talk a little bit about -- more about that. But it goes in all 3 directions in our
multipurpose network. It's for the mobility case, for the home case, and it's also for the 5G mobile edge compute case, not forgetting that, because
all 3 of them are using our multipurpose network. And when it comes to use cases, I can do some of them. But of course, on the mobile edge
compute, we see a lot of optimization in factories. We see private -- we see private 5G networks in order to keep the data and the security and the
throughput in a facility, if that's a campus, whatever, that use case has come up very early on.

On the consumer side, I guess, there's sort of a big event coming up here on Sunday. It's called Football, American Football, and you're going to 
see quite a lot on 5G experience there. What we can do with millimeter wave in the stadium, how we can use broadcasting cameras with 5G, a lot 
of new innovation, both for the consumer, but also for the distribution of content. With our spectrum positioning, we are basically unlimited 
on the uplink when it comes to stadiums, which is the big blocker today in a stadium. So I think you're going to see quite a lot next, I'd say, 4 or 5 
days on consumer cases as well as we will continue to give you more insights to it the next couple of weeks and when we meet in New York here.

The last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

I actually wanted to talk about the buyback. I was wondering if you could talk about providing any more color on the potential for timing. You 
mentioned one of the sensitivities was potential purchases of spectrum. Obviously, we had the CBRS auction, I think, in June and then C-
band, whether it's later this year or maybe early next year. Do those events have to first take place, and you have to have a better understanding of 
ultimately what you spent before you could actually start to do a buyback? Or could you actually end up doing it before?

And then secondly, there's been a lot of debate around your current MVNO relationship with various cable companies and some of your competitors 
making some comments that they're going to try to go after that. Is there a specific date when that contract expires or anything specific about 
2020 that we should be thinking about that could be a catalyst, if you will, for them wanting to leave? And how important is it to you to maintain 
that?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Colby, thanks for the questions. So on the buyback, look, it's great to be having this conversation. We're approaching our target leverage, 
had good conversations with the board for quite a while now. As we get closer to the target range, what comes next? And so glad to announce 
that change in the capital allocation model this morning.

JANUARY 30, 2020 / 1:30PM, VZ - Q4 2019 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

But as you mentioned, there's a couple of key variables as we think about capital allocation going forward here. And spectrum is the largest one
of those. So I don't know if we need to actually get through the auctions, but having line of sight to exactly when the auctions will be is kind of a
key variable. So we're very supportive of the actions the FCC is taking to try to make as much spectrum available. And as we get a little more clarity,
hopefully, in the near-term future, that will also impact our decision on timing of any buybacks.

But as you think about buybacks, the reason why we're having that conversation is the strong cash flow that we saw last year. Last year, we were
at $35.7 billion of CFFO. And even after you back out CapEx and the dividend, $7.8 billion left over. And with an expectation of EPS growth, working
capital might be a little bit of a wild card, but I would expect to see that free cash flow after dividend number be strong again this year and expect
it to be higher on a year-over-year basis. So it puts us in a great position where we can make some good decisions going forward here.

On the MVNO, so I can -- as we're having it as Service as a Strategy, this is important relationships for us. That's how we want to get 
monetization better than anybody else on our capital investments and that's why we're building a network. We are managing a multitude of 
stakeholders and the MVNOs are important. It's an ongoing relationship. And we really think it's important relationships, so that's us any sort of 
large enterprises. We see that we have both agile on the technology side and having good conversations with them, but it's no different from 
another enterprise you would have. So -- and I think it's a win-win for both of us. And hopefully, they see equally good value having MVNO on 
top of the best network in the country. At the same time as we see a value over there as well.

So we will continue to be there. And it's hard for me to comment what my competitors are saying about it. I'm not sure what insights they have.
But again, we feel good about our relationship, and we will continue to see that we are managing it as any very important customer.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

That's all the time we have today. Before I end the call, I'd like to turn it back to Hans for a couple of closing comments real quick.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. I will be brief on this one. I think we have talked about all the relevant things for Q4, 2019 and 2020, and as I said, we have our Investor Day 

coming up here in February.

So -- but all in all, I reinforce that we did a lot of transformation in 2019. The team and the organization has really responded well to it. That goes
all the way from a network change to our organization change, to our voluntary program, branding and all of that went down, and at the same
time, we've delivered a strong result. And I think we have set us up ourselves for actually continued good role. We have said that long term, we
have -- would like to have growth of GDP plus. I think the guide this year is an acceleration compared to '19, which means that the confidence level
is going up, what we can do with the core assets we have. And we still sort of have told you where 5G will come in, which is more of 2021. So we
work with assets we have right now, but we build also a great foundation on 5G going forward for the years after.

So all in all, I think the whole team, the executive team and the company feel excited coming into 2020, and that's how I sum it up. Thank you very
much for being on this call.

Operator

JANUARY 26, 2021 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share,
resulting in full year earnings of $4.30 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of
approximately $523 million. This includes a net charge of $404 million primarily related to severance, including voluntary separations under our
existing plans and the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities as well as a net loss of $119 million primarily related to the
disposition of the HuffPost business. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.21 in the fourth quarter and
$4.90 for the full year.

Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impact to earnings from the adoption of accounting
standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition is illustrated for comparability purposes and reflects a reduction in the benefit realized due to the
deferral of commission expense versus the prior year. We also continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of COVID on our business. The year-over-year
impacts of both ASC 606 and COVID were not significant in the fourth quarter.

The full year 2020 impacts from ASC 606 and COVID were $0.09 and $0.21, respectively, on both a reported and adjusted earnings per share basis.
We do not expect the adoption of ASC 606 to have a significant impact on the comparability of 2021 results to 2020. Full year adjusted EPS growth
of 1.9%, illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide, reflects the strong underlying performance of the business.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2020.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and a Happy New Year to all of you. First of all, 2020 was a challenging year. And I can only say that I'm super proud how Verizon
responded to the changing environment during 2020. And we supported our customers, our employees and the society in a way that I've never
seen before. So all in all, a great year. At the same time, we executed well on our strategy and saw that we had really good financial performance
as well.

When it comes to our 2020 strategic priorities, let me just walk through the execution of them. First of all, strengthening and grow the core business,
I'm really proud to announce that we continue to have the best network in the nation. We just got for the 15th time the overall best network with
RootMetrics on all 7 different categories. That includes 5G, which is so important to us that we continue to have that lead. I'm also happy to announce
that we won for the 26th consecutive time the J.D. Powers Award. It tells a lot about our network and technology team, how they have been
building a network and how we continue to lead this market.

When it comes to the customer innovation, you have seen us working with our customers to give them richer offering and also even better
performance of the network. This year, with Disney+, discovery+, also adding in the 5G iPhone from Apple has, of course, supported a lot of
innovation that we're doing in the Verizon Consumer Group. And we see a great migration of our customers to unlimited and to the premium
unlimited.

Finally, you can see also that Verizon Business Group has a year of investments to see that we are putting a foundation to be even stronger for the
future, had good growth in the wireless and also in some areas like the public sector, a very good performance and also adding a lot of new
customers on the enterprise side.

When it comes to us leveraging the assets to drive new growth, the commitments we did in February 2020 when it comes to 5G were all met or
exceeded. I'm extremely happy with that. We now have 64 Ultra Wideband cities. We are more than 10 cities on our home 5G Ultra Wideband. We
have 10 mobile edge compute centers public with Amazon. All in all, we deployed more than 5x more Ultra Wideband sites during 2020. And we
launched the nationwide 5G that now is covering 230 million POPs in 2,700 cities.

On the financial side, a strong year ended, where we had more than 2% growth in the wireless service revenue. We also have growth on our EPS
in the fourth quarter, over 7%. We had an operational cash flow full year of USD $41.8 billion, which is a growth of 17%, a very strong year that put
us in a good position when we go into 2021.

JANUARY 26, 2021 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

And finally, we have a really large focus on how to include all our 4 stakeholders in the work we're doing. And I'm really proud of the Citizen Verizon
that we launched during last year, which is a great way for us to see that the society aspect is part of our strategy, where, of course, our focus on
being carbon neutral is very important. And the second green bond was launched at the second half of 2020. So all in all, I have to say, it was a very
different year but a great execution, where we hit all our strategic milestones at the same time as we pivoted and supported all our stakeholders.

At the November sell-side event, I presented the 5 vectors of growth. Those are the vectors that is based on our strategy of Network-as-a-Service.
Those are also the enablers for us to get to GDP+. We have great traction on them and we also have done quite a lot in 2020, all the way from the
5G adoption to the customer differentiation that I talked a lot about, the new markets that we're addressing, still pending the acquisition of TracFone,
but we have other segments we are addressing as well as the next-generation business-to-business application based on our unique mobile edge
compute offering that we have with Amazon, also now with Microsoft and many other partners. And finally, the network monetization with our
MVNO partners, which are enjoying the best network that we have and we're building.

All in all, this is built on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that we outlined some 3 years ago and giving us the opportunity to have great
execution in the future. With that, I would like to hand over to Matt to go through the financials in a little bit more detail.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I am with the Verizon team and the results we delivered
in 2020.

In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless service revenue growth and strong results in
Verizon Media Group were offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline products.

Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.7 billion as compared to $11.1 billion last year, a 5.3% increase driven by service and other revenue growth
and disciplined spending. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.1 billion. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.7%, 90 basis points
higher than last year, including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the deferral of commission expense.

Our continued focus on our Business Excellence program has resulted in realized cumulative cash savings of $9.5 billion. And we are well positioned
to achieve our $10 billion goal ahead of our year-end 2021 target. COVID has brought about new ways of working. And we believe some of these
will be long term in nature. This will create additional savings opportunities beyond the current program.

As Brady mentioned, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.21, up 7.1% from $1.13 a year ago. We are pleased to report 1.9% growth of full
year adjusted EPS at the high end of our revised guidance, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business.

Let's now turn to cash flow results on Slide 8. Our cash generation was exceptionally strong in 2020, reflecting our subscription-based business
model and the quality of our customer base. This enabled us to continue to execute on our capital allocation model, investing in our business,
increasing our dividend for the 14th straight year and strengthening our balance sheet.

Cash flow from operating activities totaled $41.8 billion for the year, an increase of $6 billion from the prior year, driven by continued performance
and strength in the business, lower tax payments due to a one-time cash tax benefit received earlier in the year and reductions in working capital
primarily due to lower wireless volumes.

Capital spending in 2020 totaled $18.2 billion as we continued to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and
capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network and launching our nationwide 5G network. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $23.6 billion, up
32.4% year-over-year.

Throughout the year, we opportunistically diversified our debt portfolio, optimized our cost of borrowing and retained a higher level of cash as a
result of the pandemic. We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.3 billion. And our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was
approximately 2.0x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x. We remain committed to our capital allocation model.

JANUARY 26, 2021 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 9. Our competitive position is based on compelling unlimited
plans that provide choice to consumers paired with the best devices and attractive promotions, all built on the country's best network. This quarter,
we launched our nationwide 5G service to coincide with the release of the iPhone 12 lineup, which fully supports our ultra wideband offering,
enabling Verizon customers to utilize a full range of connectivity provided by this iconic device.

Partnerships remain a critical component of our value proposition. We recently added Discovery to our list of existing successful partnerships,
which includes Apple and Disney. As the early cohort of Disney+ customers have come off of the initial free 12-month period, more than 2/3 have
maintained their subscription, either through their Verizon direct billing relationship or by opting into one of our newest Mix & Match plans with
the Disney bundle included.

Volume activity in the quarter was tempered by consumer behavior, given rising COVID cases and elevated store closures that limited foot traffic
in addition to the retention offers in the market. As a result, the pool of consumers switching carriers was lower than a year ago.

Fourth quarter phone gross adds were down approximately 24% year-over-year, relatively consistent with declines experienced in the third quarter.
We are pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting as over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan and over 55% of
these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 60% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 20% of our
base taking a premium plan.

Our customer retention remains high with phone churn of 0.76% for the quarter, down 7 basis points from a year ago, contributing to postpaid
phone net adds of 163,000. Disconnects related to customers in our Stay Connected program totaled more than 135,000 phones in the quarter.

Our Stay Connected program continued to see great results with approximately 95% of customers making a payment since entering the program,
and collection cure rates are in line with our expectations. More than 50% of all customers in the program are current on their payments. December
was the final month of service billings for the program and payment activity remained stable, though we will continue to closely monitor payment
trends in 2021.

Turning to Fios. We continue to build on our strong third quarter with consumer Fios Internet net additions of 92,000, more than double the fourth
quarter of 2019. Total Fios Internet net additions of 95,000 was the best fourth quarter we have had since 2014 and reflected strong demand for
our gigabit offering as consumers continued to work and learn from home. Cord-cutting trends continued, resulting in consumer Fios Video net
losses for the quarter of 72,000.

Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $23.9 billion,
down 1.2%. This was primarily driven by a 3.8% decline in wireless equipment revenue due to softer volumes in the quarter.

For the full year, total Consumer revenue decreased 2.8% to $88.5 billion, driven by the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Consumer wireless
service revenue for the quarter was $13.6 billion, a 1.2% increase. The results reflect the resilience of our business as we recovered from a 2.7%
decrease in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we delivered ARPA growth of 1.8% year-over-year even as TravelPass and other usage fees
remain at subdued levels, demonstrating that our tiered approach to unlimited provides a strong foundation for delivering revenue growth.

For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $53.6 billion, relatively flat from 2019 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.8 billion,
a 2.5% decline from a year ago. Customer credits related to regional sports networks negatively impacted Fios revenue by 4.2% in the quarter and
also reduced our content expense. We expect Fios revenue to benefit as growth in the broadband base offsets the impact of the shift from the
triple-play bundle to stand-alone service.

Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.9% to $9.9 billion. Margins were 41.5% in the quarter, up 160 basis points from last year, including headwinds
of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 45.5%, an increase of 120 basis
points from the prior year, including an impact of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense.

JANUARY 26, 2021 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 11. Business wireless trends remained resilient throughout the year, and the fourth quarter was
no different. Public sector demand remained strong on the success of our distance learning program and support for increased needs of states
and local government agencies. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, while we experienced modest pressures in enterprise.

Business segment phone gross adds for the quarter were down 11% from the prior year due to store closures and continued economic weakness.
Segment postpaid phone churn was 0.98% in the quarter, which was down 2 basis points over the prior year. As a result, postpaid phone net adds
were 116,000.

Let's now move to Slide 12 to review the Business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment were $8.1 billion in the
fourth quarter, down slightly year-over-year. Full year operating revenues of $31 billion represented a decline of 1.5% from the prior year. Wireless
service revenue in the quarter accelerated to 7.1% year-over-year from 4.9% in the third quarter, which was more than offset by reductions in
wireless equipment volumes and secular pressure on legacy wireline products.

Looking at wireless service revenue. Public sector had a particularly strong quarter and small and medium business growth improved for the second
straight quarter, although it was still below pre-pandemic growth rates. Legacy wireline product trends appeared to be normalizing after initially
benefiting from the transition to a work-from-home economy. The growth in advanced communication services continues to drive opportunities
for the segment.

While we are pleased with the revenue performance of the Business segment and exit 2020 with momentum, there are uncertainties around how
businesses will perform in 2021, given the challenges within the macro environment. The elevated demand experienced in public sector and parts
of enterprise throughout 2020 could potentially create headwinds to growth in the Business segment, particularly in the back half of 2021.

Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, up 390 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the strength in wireless service
revenue and the benefits of our transformation initiatives, including back-office digitalization and optimization. Full year margins of 25.4% were
up slightly versus last year.

Now let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. We are very pleased with Verizon Media Group performance. Total revenue for the
quarter was $2.3 billion, up approximately 11% from a year ago, the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition. Growth in
the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends with demand side platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year. Advertising
strength came from political, consumer products, technology and retail, among other verticals.

The fourth quarter also saw continued high consumer engagement in commerce as offline-to-online shopping behaviors continued through the
holiday season on our owned and operated properties. In particular, mail e-commerce revenue growth was 7x that of the prior year. And we saw
continued strength in finance and news as daily active users grew 52% and 11%, respectively.

Let's now move on to Slide 14 for a quick look at overall wireless performance. Key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products
and services from the Consumer and Business segments are illustrated on this slide. Total wireless service revenue was up 2.2% year-over-year in
the fourth quarter and up 0.7% for the full year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental
earnings release schedules on our website.

Now let's focus on our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We are excited to deliver 2021 expectations that include accelerating revenue and earnings
growth, driven by our 5 growth vectors as wireless service strengthens and 5G continues to scale. This year, we are providing an outlook for service
and other revenue, which includes revenues from across all of our businesses but excludes wireless equipment revenue, given its variability,
especially in the current environment.

For 2021, we expect service and other revenue growth of at least 2%, reflecting an acceleration of total wireless service and Fios revenue growth
as well as continued momentum in Verizon Media, partially offset by ongoing legacy wireline product declines. Included in this outlook is total
wireless service revenue growth of at least 3%, driven by our tiered unlimited plans, new customer contributions and ongoing strength in business.

JANUARY 26, 2021 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings per share of $5 to $5.15, driven by recurring service and other revenue growth as well as
ongoing cost initiatives. We assume no significant year-over-year impact from below-the-line items based on the 2021 opening balance sheet. The
adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%.

Our consolidated capital spend for full year 2021 is expected to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, consistent with the prior year and within
our normal capital intensity range. Our focus for the year includes further expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in new and existing markets,
densification of our network to manage future traffic demands and continued deployment of our fiber infrastructure.

Our cash flows in 2021 are expected to be driven by higher operating incomes, offset by taxes and working capital. We anticipate that our cash
taxes in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, given expectations for higher pretax income this year and a one-time $2.2 billion cash tax benefit received
in the second quarter of 2020. Working capital was a tailwind in 2020 due to the lower equipment volumes, which we do not expect to repeat in
2021.

With that, I will turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our 2021 priorities.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. Let me review the 2021 priorities based on the 4 pillars of strategic priorities. Starting with the core business, and as you heard
Matt talking about accelerating the service revenue, I'm pleased that we're guiding for a plus 3% wireless service revenue growth in 2021. That's
based on that we will continue to differentiate our value proposition for customers. We also will continue to invest in our Verizon Business Group
to capture that potential we see in the Business segment with a new platform that we're developing together with our customers.

When it comes to our 5G and investing in our business, we have a big year in front of us in 2021. Again, we're going to almost double the amount
of 5G Ultra Wideband sites. We're going to have 14,000 new sites coming in during 2021. That will enable us to continue to increase with plus 20
cities when it comes to 5G Ultra Wideband. And we're also going to add some plus 20 5G Home cities, at the same time, focusing very much on
the 5G mobile edge compute with 10 more sites when it comes to the public side. And then on the private side, we will scale that network together
with the demand that has come as we know already, all underpinned with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and the fiber that we are deploying.

When it comes to the financial, Matt talked about that we continue to focus on the accelerating the earnings per share growth, now with a guidance
of $5 to $5.15 earnings per share. The year 2020 solidified our balance sheet. And we will be continued focused on the cash flow generation.

And finally, when it comes to our culture and our purpose, we have very much focused on the customer-centricity and the brand strength that we
have built in the market. That will continue as well as we will have also the Citizen Verizon totally included in the overall strategy. You see that we
are managing all the 4 stakeholders that is making the success for Verizon in the future.

So very clear, a year of execution. We have progressed 1 more year on the Verizon 2.0. We're in a great position. I'm really excited to go into 2021.
I'm pleased to announce that we will have our normal Investor Day in the early part of 2021. We will come back with the exact date in due time.

And by that, I would like to hand over to Brady for Q&A.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Hans. We're -- Brad, we're now ready to take the questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Two if I can. First, Hans, can you talk about the strategy of revenue growth from here, given the higher promotional environment? Is it important
that you grow accounts? Or can you make the revenue growth on the existing base? And clearly, you're looking for customers to move up to
premium unlimited. Where is that mix now? And then second, where are we on the fiber builds? And how should that start to come through in
revenue and expense management this year?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Phil. Let me start by the subscribers then. I mean, first of all, we came into the third quarter already, I mean, we have our model with
the migration of customers, giving them a better network and a better experience. And that is really how we are managing our base. And we came
with a good momentum in the third quarter. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, we had service revenue growing more than 2% as we said also
in the guidance.

That's so important for us because we have a model, where our net addition is part of our strategy, how we move them up. And as Matt said, we
have now more than 60% of our customers on unlimited. But more important, I mean, if you look in the fourth quarter, 90% of the new net adds
took unlimited. And out of those, 55% took premium. And the premium is, of course, where we are adding in the 5G, we're adding in discovery+,
Disney+. The way that our -- that Ronan and his team has worked with this migration pattern, we believe -- and as you heard in the guidance that
Matt talked about, we believe that we can continue that work with organic service -- wireless service revenue growth with the model we now have.
And we have proven the model over the years.

And let's also remember the Business side has performed very well when it comes to the wireless account. I mean we are so strong with the public
sector, with the large enterprises on the wireless side. So that is giving us a lot of positives going into 2021 with the guidance we have of continued
service revenue growth on the wireless side. And we'll constantly measure what the actions we're taking, but we feel good about it.

When it comes to the fiber question, yes, we continue to roll out fiber. We are probably in the year 3 or 4 right now. We -- I would say with the
majority or vast majority of all the 5G sites, they have our own fiber. We are migrating our 4G sites also, where it's a good return on investment to
our own fiber. And over time, we will also open up opportunities for resell to our enterprise customers and wholesale. So I think that we are seeing
that benefit already on the 5G build because we are using our own fiber.

To get the full impact, we also have a couple of years left in order to have it in all the areas. But we have come a far way on the fiber build, and we
will continue to do it where it makes sense for a return on investment. So we feel really good about that. And that's part of our Verizon Intelligent
Edge Network.

The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

I believe you called out in the release that COVID ended up being a $0.02 benefit in the quarter. I imagine that was probably a mix of things that
were good and bad. I was hoping you maybe could give us a little bit of insight into that. And then the EPS guidance that you gave for this year,

what are you assuming about the COVID impacts over the course of this year? And if you could give us any insight on how that breaks out? And
then also one last question on guidance, does that factor in any potential future spectrum purchases? Or does it just reflect the portfolio spectrum
you have today?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can start with the latter question, and Matt can come back to the first. So when it comes to our guidance for EPS in 2021, of course, there are
uncertainties of the pandemic and so on. But some things we know. I mean the roaming charges will continue to be a headwind. We also think
that as the pandemic and economic recoveries is coming back probably latter part of '21, the public sector will not have an equally strong year as
they had in 2020. We also believe the SMB will continue to be subdued and have a challenge in '21. And as we saw during the full year, the switcher
pool has been lower due to the traffic in the stores, et cetera. So that's were factored in.

But on the other hand, we have line of sight to what we're doing because we're executing on a strategy when it comes to migration of our customers,
what we're doing in Verizon Business Group and also Verizon Media Group. As Matt said, I mean, they were now, for the first time ever, have a
year-on-year growth with 11%. All in all, that is giving us the confidence that we can live up to this guidance. But there are some uncertainties and
there are some headwinds from COVID. But we think that with those assumptions we have, we can actually do this. And this is continued work
with the EPS growth and acceleration that we have talked about for so many years right now. And we continue to show that we can do it with the
assets we have and how we're executing. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say while certainly some level of pressures
will continue to exist on the business throughout the year, I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic, but we're not overly optimistic either. We
assume some level of pressures. But you saw from the second half of the year, our ability to still execute within that type of environment.

In terms of the fourth quarter, as you say, there was actually -- the COVID impact was actually a $0.02 benefit. And what you saw there was there
was a couple of one-timers, but primarily it was a case of the revenue pressures we saw declining versus what we've seen in 2Q and 3Q. You think
media as an example, which had been significantly hit by COVID impacts earlier in the pandemic but certainly no impact in 4Q as we recorded that
11% revenue growth there.

So those revenue -- some of the revenue headwinds moderated in the fourth quarter. The expense benefits continued. That's why you saw the
$0.02 net benefit, which actually completely offsets the $0.02 headwind from 606. So if you kind of think about in the fourth quarter, 606 and COVID
having no net impact on the results, and that $1.21 stands on its own, the 7% increase on a year-over-year basis.

Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

Hans, I wonder if you could talk about 5G monetization in 2021. You mentioned the expansion of the network, the Ultra Wideband Network, more
5G Home locations, more mobile edge compute. So can you just take us through both on the Consumer side, particularly 5G Home and on the B2B
side, what we should be looking for and what you're kind of including in your forecast for '21?

JANUARY 26, 2021 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2020 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes, absolutely. No, we're excited about the 5G in 2021. I mean, on the mobility side, we're already seeing monetization happening. I mean, in the
fourth quarter, with so many customers taking the premium and going for unlimited, that's sort of where we have our sweet spot with the 5G. And
of course, with the Apple iPhone right now in 5G, that has now kicked off that. So that you will see through the year when it comes to our mobility
case.

When it comes to 5G Home, we have very solid progress in 2020, came out with this new CPE. We added some 12 cities now with 5G Home with
the NR technology. And our plan is doing 20-plus markets more in 2021. So now we're starting to get a solid foundation for the 5G Home. And as
you heard in my remarks, I mean, we are doubling the amount of sites almost in 2021. So we're now getting to a very, very solid positioning there.

But I said before, on the Ultra Wideband build, we're building it mainly in the dense urban areas and then in stadiums, et cetera, in the beginning.
So we covered less of houses or residentials in the beginning. But as these continue right now, we're capturing more and more. So I'm really excited.
We also know that the CPE is really good. So -- and the self-install is working well. So we're looking forward to seeing that happening over the year
more and more.

On the 5G mobile edge compute, we have a great funnel of customers on the Business side. And we are not expecting that will be in significant
revenues in the '21. But you're going to see a lot of customers signing up for the 5G mobile edge compute, both the private and the public, in '21
in order for us to have a very solid base going into '22.

So a lot of excitement around 5G. I think we have built it absolutely right. We have an opportunity in front of us that we have been working on for
a couple of years right now. So I'm happy with my sales team. I'm happy with the technology team. And we have a big year in front of us.

The next question is from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Great. I've got three quick ones. First, in terms of the 3%-plus service revenue growth, can you give us a sense in terms of whether that's weighted
more towards subs or ARPA improvement? Obviously, you guys, in your commentary, talked about some of the headwinds to the sub growth. I'm
just wondering if you guys think you can maintain sub growth as you look through the year. That's number one.

Number two, just any thoughts on the ability to continue to drive margin improvement in the business, given that -- considering you're close to
achieving the $10 billion in savings. And then lastly, sort of a follow-up to Brett's question, is the CapEx guide that we've heard, is that something
that could be revised during the year if the circumstances change?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Let me start. I mean on the 3% growth, I think we have our strategy when it comes to how to grow it with the migration of customers and all of
that. And as always, the team is validating how to make offerings, if we should be more aggressive or not. But we always think about doing long-term
positive impact for our shareholders financially. And you have seen us now working for the last 2.5 years since we launched unlimited, we are doing
the right things in order to make a long-term impact positively for shareholders and for our customers.

And so especially Ronan and the team there have quite a lot in the portfolio, but we have now proven that this model is working when it comes
to migration of unlimited with the best network and adding in also new value-added services, everything from Disney+ to discovery+, Apple Music,
and it might be more coming up in the year as well. So I'm confident that the guys have that in the portfolio. And as you heard about the Disney+,

it's -- I think it's just unheard of how we can help direct to consumers. I mean 2/3 are signing up or more than 2/3 are signing up to continue the
service after 1 year. I think that is something standing out.

On the EBITDA, I will -- Matt will come back later on. But I can say that we continued with efficiency. And it's a reason why we are giving a guidance
that we will grow the EPS again. And the majority or all of it is basically above the line, as Matt said. So this is operational improvements and
improvements as we are growing our top line. Again, we have proven the model, the 5 vectors of growth. And now we're in the middle of executing.

And finally, on CapEx, this is what we need to do right now. We -- the technology team has all the means they have to execute on a strategy with
assets we have today. The only thing I can say, as I said I'm not sure 100 times before, we will only increase CapEx if we find something that has a
really good return on investment. And then we'll come back and talk about it. Right now, we have everything that we need to execute the plans
that we have in front of us.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So hey, John, so back to your couple of questions around the guide. As you think about the 3% service revenue, it's really a combination of
subs and ARPA. Hans obviously talked through all of the things that will drive the ARPA side of the equation. But we certainly do expect subs
growth, account growth. And net add growth is important to our business as well. We will do that in a disciplined way. We're not going to chase
unprofitable growth. But you should expect to see volume growth in the business as well as ARPA growth.

And then the margin improvement, cost savings where, as you mentioned, we're close to the achieving the $10 billion program well ahead of the
end of 2021 timeline that we put in place. But just because we hit that doesn't mean we'll stop. There's significant opportunities to continue to
make our business more efficient. The teams are very focused on those. And the $10 billion goal won't change us -- won't slow us down at all from
continuing with that.

As you think about margin improvement, obviously, revenue will be a big driver of that and then you combine that with the cost savings. The one
thing I would say is as we have an improvement in EBITDA margin dollars, if we have equipment revenue increase this year, which we would
certainly be glad to see an indication of the overall economic activity picking up, you'd see an impact of that in the EBIT margin. So you could have
EBIT dollars grow, but margins not grow as much, just because of the impact on the numerator and denominator from the equipment revenue.
But we're certainly very much focused on the dollar side to that equation and excited with the guide we have for the year.

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD

Hans, I guess, the first question for you, just on the strategy side with the sale of the HuffPost, is this the beginning of a dismantling of the Verizon
Media business? Is it on the block? What is the game plan for that unit as we think longer term for Verizon?

And then I guess the second question would be for Matt. Matt, you called out that the 2H '21 might have some tough comps for the Business side
of the business. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on what that might be and what the numbers might look like?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. On the Verizon Media Group, I just want to remember you that we started this journey somewhere in 2018, resetting the overall strategy
of Verizon Media Group. We started with that. We started to take out cost. We changed the product portfolio. We went into a very clear brand value
of trust and privacy.

The team has just done an outstanding job. I mean they have been bringing this from sort of going down with a decrease in growth of 15% to 20%
per quarter. And now they're turning around with extremely sharp products as including also consolidating some, I'm not sure if it was 10 or 15
different ad tech platforms to 1. I think it's a great -- we have put them in a position that we're really happy with. So I'm looking for how these guys
will execute. And we are now in the position where I wanted it to be.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

And then David, on your question on the VBG volumes. So certainly, as you think about what we've seen this year, especially in the public sector
part of Verizon Business Group, very, very strong year. Obviously, some of that is due to the circumstances that we've seen across the country. So
I would actually be very happy if we saw some pressure on those volumes in the second half of the year. That would mean good things were
happening elsewhere that would be very supportive of our Consumer business, very supportive of our SMB businesses as well.

So certainly, it's part of some of the uncertainty that exists as we think about the year. But just wanted to call out the fact that if we see the
improvements we expect, we may see the -- some impact there on the public sector side of our Verizon Business Group volumes. But as I say, I
think that would be more than offset by other parts of the business. So what you've seen and what we expect in '21 is a continuation of what you
saw in 2020 is that as we have so many different parts of the business, irrespective of how the macro environment plays out, we can put together
very strong consolidated results.

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

I wonder if we could just talk about the competitive environment in wireless for a moment. Your gross additions remain, especially in Consumer
but across Consumer and Business, way down. Your churn rate remains very good and your sort of ARPU shows signs of improving. That's sort of
a different story than what we've seen for the last few years, which it sort of speaks to perhaps a moderation of competitive intensity but clearly a
weakening of your ability to acquire new subscribers. I wonder if you could just talk about that for a bit and talk about how you see that evolving
in the 5G era as we -- particularly now that more and more of the handsets that are being sold are 5G handsets.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. First of all, I think the competitive landscape is always there and competition is also equal. I think that we just have a little bit different
strategy. I mean, first of all, quality net adds is for us very, very important. And as you can see, we are adding these very important net adds. We
want quality customers that likes our network, that likes our offerings and our experience. And if you look at what we have done in the last 2.5
years with our migration story, that's exactly what we have done. And that's what you see impact in the fourth quarter.

We're growing our service revenue as well as the guidance for next year. So we are confident with the strategy we have, and that might not be the
same strategy that others have, that we can grow. And that's part of the 5 growth vectors we have to get to GDP+. And with the guidance that
Matt gave or we gave with plus 3% on the wireless service revenue, I think we have all the confidence in the model we have and how we'll work
with. But it's also true that the switcher pool during 2020 in the fourth quarter was lower due to COVID, less traffic and all of that. So -- but all in all,
we are very pleased with the high-quality net additions that we are getting and that we can create growth with that and continues on. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans. Craig, I think the retention side of the business is performing very, very well. And we're doing that through the quality of the
network, the quality of the customer experience and not having to do anything additional to drive that type of retention numbers that you see.
So it's been a very strong story there. And we would expect that to continue.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner

And if I could just squeeze in one more question if I could because -- and sorry to change topics. But your video strategy seems to be now quite
different in wireline and wireless, where in wireless, you're clearly with Disney and Discovery. You're sort of playing the Switzerland neutral arms
dealer.

I wonder if it raises any questions about for Fios. Does it make sense to stay in the video business as you currently have it, where you're still selling
a direct package? Or would it make sense to move to a similar strategy for the wireline side, where you sort of offer more third-party aggregators,
if you will, across your network?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Craig. No, first of all, you're absolutely right. On the wireless side, our D2C strategy is great. We have a platform that nobody else when
it comes to distribution, brand and network. And we can cope with this. We're not going to have 100 different type of offerings. But the discovery+,
the Disney+, they are sort of super A brands that we want to work with or Apple Music. We will look for more of these to see that they're fitting
into our customer base, that they like it and are willing both to upgrade and migrate. So we'll continue with that.

On the Fios side, of course, we will continue with the video right now. But you have seen us also, starting with Mix & Match, starting to shop up
this because ultimately, I want our customers to have choices. And I want them to choose. If they want the D2C solution or if they want a linear or
they want over-the-top, they should be able to choose it. And look at the numbers in the fourth quarter again. We continue to grow our Fios Internet
customers and we have a decline in the video customers. That's good for us, I mean, financially. But ultimately, it is to meet our customers' needs.

And I think the whole setup that we did in Verizon 2.0 is just catered for us to do things that we never thought about before. We have a Consumer
division thinking about how are we now delivering to consumers. And that's what you see in the numbers. That's what you see in the numbers
that we have. We have the same in Verizon Business Group. They are thinking totally different we have done before. And we still have more to do
with platforms and things to be even more scalable and be able to bring more to the bottom line. But I have to say, I'm pleased. And I hope that
you guys, what you see, are pleased as well. I mean the strategy is working. We have the 5 vectors of growth. We're going into 2021, we have proof
points on all those 5, including the video strategy you asked about.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Two questions if I could. First, if you look at the improvement in postpaid churn year-over-year, can you unpack what portion of that might be
coming from the pandemic and the lower switcher pool versus what's coming from the Verizon initiatives on the network strategy, the tiering and
content bundling that you're doing or any other factors that you think may be improving retention? And then secondly, on the wireline business,
is there at some point down the road a step-function opportunity to take margins up, especially as you've continued to fiberize the local footprint?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. I will start and will let Matt make some comments as well. But on the postpaid churn, I think that we are just having a great moment
with our customers. They love our network and the performance we have and the additions we're doing with 5G and 5G Ultra Wideband. At the
same time, our offerings are so distinct and different than anybody else in the market, where they can go to the unlimited premium together with
discovery+ or Disney+ or Disney+ plus, plus. We have ESPN and Hulu included. I think nobody else has those type of things in the market. And our
partners, at least if you ask them, I think you should, are very happy and pleased on how we can deal with this. We are happy with it, both from a
retention but also from a bottom line side. We were making money on this, which is the whole idea with the Network-as-a-Service that we're
building on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network.

On the wireline side, I think the whole idea of the Verizon Business Group is really to see that we are working these year-over-year. This is nothing
that you fix in a month or a quarter or 2. This is things that we need to invest in a billing system, direct-to-consumer, call centers, everything being
set up to deliver scalable platforms for our customer in the Business side. That will, over time, improve our margins in the Verizon Business Group.
And I think that if you look at 2020, I mean, it was a good performance of them, still doing investments in order to get where we want to get over
time. And then we add to that new opportunities, like 5G mobile edge compute. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So just back on the postpaid churn, Mike, for a second. The -- certainly, there is a pandemic contribution, but as Hans mentioned, a lot of
Verizon-specific pieces, too. I'd also point out that the fourth quarter churn number included the impact. If you think about the Stay Connected
customers, there was a delay in those customers going all the way through a collections process and so on.

And so you had a positive benefit from that in Q2 and 3Q, a little bit of a catch-up in 4Q. But even with that, a very strong churn number, and it's
just based off of the best network experience as you saw confirmed again by RootMetrics yesterday. When you put that together with everything
else we do, customers who get on the Verizon network want to stay on the Verizon network.

The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Crédit Suisse.

Doug Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD

Hans, I just wondered -- I was hoping you reflect back on the arrival of 5G in the United States. And the prompt is I think a lot of people thought
the iPhone 12 being the 5G and having all your bands in it would start a bit of a super cycle or not a bit of one, but a super cycle for consumers
adopting 5G in the United States.

So I'm just curious how much of it sort of not happening in that way as due to the pandemic and the lack of getting people to retail versus the lack
of applications that would really just sort of delight consumers and get them to upgrade and how you think that's going to evolve over the next
year or 2 or 3. Is it going to be sort of a slow walk? Or is there something exciting around the quarter?

And then for Matt, I'm just curious, beyond working capital, any other free cash flow swing factors for 2021? And is there any way to size or quantify
working capital? It's kind of hard to tell looking historically what normal might be.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

When we talk about devices and what's happening with the upgrades and so on, I mean, remember also that the Apple 5G phone came out, I
would say, late in the fourth quarter. That's when this all started, at the same time as we had the pandemic. Still, I would say we are very pleased
what we have seen with our customer migrating to 5G. Remember, we have a fair share or a big share of Apple users in our base.

So I think that this is a pretty normal, maybe some a little bit subdued, but it's very normal upgrade cycle that we will see. And 5G will just getting
better and better. I mean that's what's happening. I mean we are fortifying our network. We're improving the performance constantly. I remember
when I talked about Ultra Wideband reaching maybe 1 gigabit per second, now we're up to 4, 5. So there's so much more to do. And the same goes
for our nationwide, improving all the time, performance better. So I think that is coming together as the accessibility to phones are coming out
much more and all the main brands have a 5G phone and all of them with ultra wideband.

So I think that we will see that continuing into '21 and '22. But there are longer cycles today when it comes to customers migrating to new phone.
They're very attached to it. But I think this is no different than 4G cycle. I think we actually are -- this is going faster than the 4G cycle. It's just that
our memories are so short, so we don't remember that. But clearly, this is equal to, to better than what we saw in the 4G cycle that happened some
10 years ago, which I refer to myself when I talk about my memory, so nobody else. Okay, Matt.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Hans. So on the cash flow question, Doug, so when you talk about the swing factors, obviously, it starts with higher earnings for the year.
Above-the-line earnings will be obviously the largest driver in the cash flow for 2021. In terms of things that potentially go the other way from a
cash flow standpoint, we would expect obviously higher earnings will lead to higher cash taxes. But in addition to that, we had the $2.2 billion
one-time cash tax benefit in the second quarter last year that obviously won't repeat. So that will be a year-over-year difference in the cash flow.

And then working capital, as you say, the biggest item working capital is going to be in the receivables side, predominantly on the handsets.
Obviously, as volumes go down, the amount of device payment contracts with customers we're doing goes down as well. So even if we don't see
an uptick in volumes this year, if they're just flat year-over-year, you have the removal of that tailwind from last year. So all in all, you're going to
see the increase from higher earnings with some offsets from cash taxes and hopefully, on the equipment receivables side are going to be the key
factors in there.

The next question comes from Peter Supino of Bernstein.

Peter Supino - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Research Analyst

I wondered if you could discuss the service revenue outlook, and specifically within Consumer, the incremental margin characteristics of the service
revenue growth that you expect. How -- do you expect that revenue to be any more or less profitable than a normal level of service revenue?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I think that was outlined in the guidance for 2021. We are looking for profitable growth. And that is how Verizon has worked as long as I recall. Now
I haven't been here all my life, but we work with profitable growth. And that is in the Consumer group as well. We will see that we have the best
offers for our customers and we will manage our P&L at the same time. And we will be aggressive, if it's needed, to get long-term effects. But as
you can see from the guidance, it's a profitable growth we're looking for. We should be able to both grow as well as making that a profitable growth.
And that's in the guidance.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Peter, I think that's exactly it. If the 3-plus percent service revenue guide is going to drive -- is driving the EPS growth, that's in the guide as
well. So certainly, it's profitable growth. In terms of comparing it to historical incremental revenue, I think there is obviously different components
all the time.

But absolutely, everything that we're doing to step customers up from a revenue standpoint also creates incremental lifetime value with those
customers. So you should expect that to be a continuation of how we approach the marketplace that we bring customers on, and we do it in a way
that creates significant economic value for us over the long term as we provide best-in-class experiences for those customers. Nothing changes
there in our mindset.

The last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen.

Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst

Just want to circle back on CapEx for a moment. I feel like messaging earlier in the year was that CapEx in 2021 would be up. And if you look at
Street expectations, they were indeed expecting CapEx to be up in '21 versus '20. So I'm just trying to get a sense what might have changed to
have the CapEx guidance flat year-over-year.

Secondly, Biden is proposing increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%. I'm curious how you think about that and whether that would have a huge
impact on free cash flow and dividend coverage. Or do you think that there will be offsets that you'd be able to kind of absorb much of that increase?
And then just as a housekeeping, is TracFone included in your 2021 guidance?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So thanks, Colby. And maybe I'll go in reverse order there. We -- while we expect TracFone to close in the second half of the year, our guidance
is -- doesn't assume any significant impact on the EPS during the year. But we'll update that if necessary, during the year.

Corporate taxes, our assumption, as you heard in the guide, 23% to 25%. That's where we've been the last few years. Obviously, we do our outlook
based off of what is on the legislative books. And so we do it based on what's there right now. We look forward to seeing how the new administration
works on a number of different issues. And if that changes the way we look at the business going forward, we'll obviously talk about that at the
appropriate time. But we're very confident in the business.

Look, we had good dividend coverage when we had a much higher tax rate not too many years ago. So while we certainly believe that the current
rate has been very helpful in job creation and in economic growth creation, we're certainly very comfortable with how our business is set up as
the administration is looking at different things.

And in terms of CapEx, I think what you're seeing is a very efficient capital deployment model within the company. That's why you see a guide
that's in line year-over-year as we continue to do all of the things that we've done, whether that be on LTE, the 5G build. You heard Hans talk about
our goals for the ultra wideband build this year, continuing the fiber build-out. And so I think the team has got a very good momentum going
there. As they've got more into those things, the efficiencies continue. That's why you see the guide where it is.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Colby. Let me hand it back over to you, Brad, and we'll close up the call.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share,
resulting in full year earnings of $5.32 per share on a GAAP basis.

Reported fourth quarter earnings include a net pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes a charge of $2.4 billion
for the early extinguishment of debt, a $106 million charge related to severance, a $1.2 billion credit pertaining to the annual mark-to-market for
our pension and OPEB liabilities and a net gain of $131 million primarily related to the disposition of an investment. Excluding the effect of these
special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the fourth quarter and $5.39 for the full year.

We completed the acquisition of TracFone on November 23. The revenue associated with TracFone this year was approximately $700 million higher
than the revenue received from TracFone in the fourth quarter of 2020. All of this revenue flows through our consumer group.

As noted in our press release this morning, beginning in 2022, our adjusted earnings per share will exclude amortization of acquisition-related
intangible assets. For 2021, such intangible amortizations negatively impacted adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.11. And for 2022,
we anticipate the impact to be approximately $0.17 to $0.19.

Finally, we will be hosting our Annual Investor Day event on March 3 in New York City, where our leadership team will provide further details on
our company's exciting plans for this year and beyond.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of 2021.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and happy new year to all of you. This past week has been one of the best since I joined Verizon. On January 19, we successfully
launched 5G Ultra Wideband on C-Band, which will enable more Americans than ever before to experience a transformative speed, reliability and
power of our multipurpose network on the go, in their home or for their businesses.

Our work throughout 2021 brought us to this moment, and I will spend this call discussing how we got here and how our accomplishment will
accelerate our growth. I want to thank our incredible V team for all your hard work and dedication throughout 2021 and for delivering for our
customers and our communities.

We have never executed so well on so many strategic and operational objectives as we did in 2021. This was a catalyst year for Verizon, and I'm
very proud of our work. We have a clear and disciplined strategy based on our multipurpose network that creates economies of scale and new
business models in an era where broadband is essential to our customers and society.

Our results clearly confirm that our strategy is working and that 2021 was a transformative year for Verizon, and it clearly sets us up for a high-impact
year in 2022. We have now assembled the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of high-quality assets, leveraging our best-in-class technology
to extend our network leadership to address more opportunities than anyone else in the market.

We're widely being recognized for both what we have accomplished. And for the 28th time in a row, J.D. Power ranked Verizon first for network
quality. This is our 175th J.D. Power Network Quality Award in 18 years. At the same time, we continue to support our 4 stakeholders: shareholders,
customers, employees and society as a responsible business.

Verizon leads the industry in sustainability. We are ranked ahead of our peers, both by the Drucker Institute and Just 100, and we are confident
that our multi-stakeholder strategy will lead to long-term shareholder value.

We have a team and expertise to lead the country into a vibrant mobile computing future. Verizon has the best engineers in the world, and they
have built a world's foremost reliable and scalable network. This asset is the foundation and the catalyst for our accelerating growth.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

So we begin 2022 with a strong portfolio of assets. We're executing our 5G strategy, making great progress on our 5 vectors of growth and delivering
a premier customer experience. This significant momentum sets us up for 2022 and beyond.

Let me give an update on the financial and operation metrics. During 2021's first quarter, we set clear targets. As we close out 2021 and enter in
2022, I'm proud to report that we delivered on all of them plus some, and our achievements will only capitalize even greater value creation in 2022.

On our January 19 C-band deployment, we covered more than 90 million POPs and millions of homes in more than 1,700 cities, well ahead of plan
on making excellent use of the incremental capital spend to augment and accelerate our business opportunities.

Today, we cover more than 95 million POPs, as the team is progressing. We also brought more than 15,000 additional 5G Ultra Wideband small
cells in service, exceeding our annual goal and nearly doubling our total 5G millimeter wave presence, increasing our fiber footprint to create a
state-of-the-art multipurpose network.

At our Investor Day last year, we said we would have 5% to 10% traffic in urban areas covered by millimeter wave. Today, we're almost at 10%. It's
exceeding our expectation. This confirms our millimeter wave strategy.

All this sets stage for last week's Verizon Ultra Wideband launch. We're excited and pleased with what we have seen so far from customer reception
to network performance. We have grown our network significantly. We finished 2021 with over 20 million households covered for our fixed wireless
access solutions, and C-band adds millions more homes.

For business, our initial C-band expansion will cover more than 1.7 million organizations with the Verizon 5G business Internet across 900 cities.
We will reach new retail and business clients by offering a breadth of plan options that make our capabilities relevant to their lives.

Our new mix and match 4.0 offerings allow customers to pick the 5G plan they want with options for savings on home Internet. For businesses, we
offer business unlimited offerings that bring choice and power to the professional market.

In addition to our network achievements, we closed on 2 large strategic transactions in 2021. We sold Verizon Media Group to Apollo Global
Management for $5 billion in a transaction that closed in September, retaining minority ownership. And in November, we completed our strategic
acquisition of TracFone, positioning Verizon as the #1 provider within the value segment. This opportunity enabled us to deepen our relationship
with new customers, while delivering more enhanced services.

TracFone is being rapidly integrated into our operation. The acquisition added 20 million customers to our prepaid model and cements Verizon
as a leading prepaid vendor at Walmart and Best Buy, forming a strong foundation for our retail efforts.

We also continue to reach new customers through bundled Internet telephone and television services. Fios Internet adds in 2021 were our best
since 2014, and we continue to expand availability of the best-in-class service.

Importantly, we strengthened our relationship with our customers, adding more connections, including more than 0.5 million new wireless postpaid
phone net adds, while maintaining and cultivating our loyal, high-quality relationships.

We provided additional value for our customers through our unique partnership strategy with the best brands that are meaningful to people, lives
and businesses. This includes content partnership with NFL, Disney, Apple, Discovery and Niantic, to name a few.

For businesses, we offer mobile edge compute capabilities, something we're first in the world with, alongside industry leaders like AWS, Google
and Microsoft.

Disruptions to consumer and industrial supply chains throughout 2021 and extending into this year have affected all industries and brought digital
connectivity to the central focus in the lives of our stakeholders. That said, Verizon has executed effectively under these conditions, as demonstrated
by our successful network expansion and network service launches.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Once again, our financial performance demonstrates that our strategy is working. Our focus on profitable volume continues to drive wireless service
revenue growth of 4.7% in 2021. And in the fourth quarter, 74% of our customers subscribed to an unlimited plan compared to 71% in Q3. Just
over 1/3 of our unlimited subscribers have unlimited premium. This leaves room for continued step-up expansion.

Our multipurpose network and flexible plans will also encourage customers to upgrade handsets and devices. We saw quick adoption of 5G
handsets throughout 2021 in anticipation on new services. 1/3 of our customers' handsets are now 5G-enabled compared to about 25% in the
third quarter.

We raised our earnings per share and wireless service revenue guidance during the year and delivered on both, including 10% EPS growth. We
promised also $10 billion in cost savings, and we delivered ahead of schedule. However, we continuously strive to more efficiently manage our
business.

We generated strong cash flows to support our investments and financial commitment, and we delivered our 15th consecutive year of increased
dividend payments, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet.

As for our focus on ESG, Citizen Verizon has also delivered on its promises. We took action towards meeting our 2025 goals, including spending to
support technology education and adoption to bridge digital divide and contracting for significant renewable energy capacity, positioning the
company to achieve over 50% renewable energy goal by 2025.

Matt will elaborate on our performance and 2022 guidance in detail. But we will target organic service and other revenue of around 3% as well as
EBITDA growth of 2% to 3%.

With the right assets in place and a sound strategy to reach consumers and businesses with 5G capabilities and mobile edge computing on our
multipurpose network, Verizon has unlimited potential. 2022 will demonstrate this.

Now I will turn the call over to Matt to walk you through our fourth quarter and full year performance in greater detail.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results where we
continue to deliver strong financial and operating performance.

Before I get into the 2021 results, let me add my own congratulations to the Verizon team for achieving our C-band build targets well ahead of
schedule and for the successful commercial launch last week. The C-band deployment provides so many opportunities for us.

As Hans mentioned, our strategy is working, and these results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively to drive new high-quality customers
to our platforms, while also serving our best-in-class customer base. We do this with the financial discipline that enables us to deliver attractive
service revenue growth and profitability, as evidenced by another strong earnings performance with healthy cash generation. It starts with our
award-winning networks, which enable both our consumer and business organizations to deliver the best products, services and experiences to
customers.

With the acquisition of TracFone, the deployment of C-band spectrum, new mix and match plans and the strongest and most innovative team in
the industry, 2022 is positioned to be our best year yet.

Let's take a look at these results beginning on Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, consolidated total revenue was $34.1 billion, down 1.8% from the prior
year. Adjusting for the sale of Verizon Media Group on September 1, consolidated revenue grew 4.8%. Strong wireless service revenue growth and
wireless equipment revenue were offset by continued declines in legacy wireline products.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Total wireless service revenue was up 6.5% for the quarter. The results were driven by a combination of ARPA and volume growth, consistent with
our strategy and the contribution from the TracFone acquisition.

For the full year, wireless service revenue grew 4.7%, including TracFone, and was in line with the increased guidance we provided at the end of
the third quarter when adjusted for the TracFone acquisition.

Total Fios revenue was $3.2 billion and grew 5.7% for the fourth quarter driven by strong customer demand for our high-quality connectivity
services. Full year Fios revenue was approximately $12.7 billion, up 4.6% over the prior year.

Service and other revenue grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, while on a reported basis, it declined
5.4% from the prior year.

Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $11.8 billion, relatively flat compared to last year, as growth in Consumer was offset by
declines in Business and the impact of the Verizon Media Group sale.

Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $48.4 billion, up 2.8% from the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2%, down 50 basis
points, primarily due to higher equipment revenues.

Earlier in the year and ahead of schedule, we achieved our $10 billion Business Excellence cost savings goal. We continue to drive efficiency in the
business, while operating with the best cost structure in the industry and expect strong operating leverage as we execute across all of our 5 vectors
of growth.

As Brady mentioned, for the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.31, up 8.3% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our business. For the
full year, adjusted EPS of $5.39 was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance range and is a 10% increase over 2020 results.

Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. The strength of our networks and brand, combined with our effective go-to-market strategy, are
driving improved competitive performance in the market. We continue to expand our high-quality mobility base, with strong performance across
consumer and business. At the same time, accelerating fixed wireless sales are complementing strong Fios results, expanding our broadband
growth opportunity.

For the quarter, we delivered 558,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, an increase over the 279,000 achieved during the same period last
year. Postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.81%, roughly in line with the same period last year and better than pre-pandemic levels, reflecting
the enduring loyalty of our customer base through ordinary and extraordinary times.

Total broadband net adds, which includes Consumer and Business Fios, DSL and fixed wireless, totaled 106,000, up 30,000 from the prior year. Fios
Internet net adds were 55,000, another strong result.

Even with a slight uptick in involuntary churn, we continue to experience exceptionally low Fios Internet churn, as customers trust the reliability
of our network and value the simplicity of our mix and match pricing. Our full year Internet net adds of 360,000 represented the best annual
performance since 2014, and we now have 6.9 million Fios Internet customers.

Demand for our fixed wireless access services continue to grow, even before our C-band deployment. FWA net adds, which include both consumer
and business fixed wireless products, totaled 78,000, up from 55,000 last quarter. This brings our total FWA customer base to approximately 223,000
at the end of the year.

Now let's turn to our Consumer group results. Fourth quarter represented another strong financial performance for Consumer, highlighted by our
best Fios revenue growth in the 2.0 era, wireless service revenue momentum and healthy profitability. We are clearly seeing the benefits of a
focused go-to-market organization.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Consumer operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $25.7 billion, up 7.4% year-over-year. Service and other revenue of $19.4 billion was up
5.2% versus the prior year due to strong wireless and Fios revenue growth and a partial quarter contribution from TracFone. As Brady mentioned,
the net revenue change from TracFone was approximately $700 million in the quarter, which included incremental service revenue of approximately
$500 million year-over-year.

For the full year, total consumer revenue increased 7.6% from a year ago to $95.3 billion, and service and other revenue rose 3.4% to $75.5 billion.
Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter rose 7.7% to $14.6 billion, reflecting ongoing step-ups into unlimited and premium plans as
well as the contribution from TracFone.

Postpaid ARPA increased 3.2% from the year ago period driven by a higher premium unlimited mix and growth from products and services, such
as content, cloud and device protection plans.

For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $56.1 billion, up 4.7% from 2020 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.9 billion for the
fourth quarter, up 5.6% from the year-ago period driven primarily by the strong growth in our broadband base.

For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.3 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year, or more than $400 million, driven by the service revenue growth. Margins were
40.3%, down 120 basis points from last year due to higher equipment revenues associated with increased volumes.

For the full year, EBITDA was $41.6 billion, up approximately $1.4 billion or 3.4% versus the prior year. Margins were 43.7%, down from 45.5% in
the prior year as a result of the approximately 28% equipment revenue growth in the year.

Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our Consumer operating metrics. Our flexible mix and match plans are at the heart of our go-to-market strategy,
supporting continued strong demand for higher-tier premium mobility and broadband offerings.

Postpaid phone net adds were 336,000 in the quarter. We competed effectively during the holiday season, even as the switcher pool remains soft
compared to pre-pandemic levels due to elevated retention promotions in the marketplace.

Fourth quarter phone gross adds were up approximately 11% compared to the same period last year, but were approximately 15% lower than the
2019 level. We continue to achieve strong customer retention with postpaid phone churn of 0.77% for the fourth quarter, relatively flat compared
to the same period last year and well below pre-pandemic levels, even as trading volumes pick back up.

We maintained the momentum of attracting high-quality customers, with approximately 60% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan
and over 1/3 of our base accounts now on a premium unlimited tier.

5G penetration continued to expand, with approximately 34% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device at year-end. We expect
to drive further 5G ultra wideband adoption with the launch last week of our C-band spectrum to more than 90 million POPs, combined with our
updated mix and match offerings introduced earlier this month.

With the close of the acquisition, TracFone results are now included in Consumer prepaid. We finished the year as the nation's leading value segment
provider, with approximately 24 million total prepaid customers, including the approximately 20 million customers acquired from TracFone.

For the quarter, prepaid net customer losses totaled 85,000, which included 52,000 net losses on the TracFone businesses stemming from stronger
demand for postpaid plans due to promos in that segment, coupled with handset supply constraint.

Now let's move to Slide 10 to review the Business group result. Operating revenue for the business segment was $7.8 billion in the fourth quarter,
down 3.0% year-over-year. We faced elevated pressures in the quarter in both public sector and wholesale, and we expect these pressures to
moderate in 2022.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Full year operating revenue was $31.0 billion, up slightly year-over-year, driven by strong wireless performance. Wireless service revenue increased
1.5%, and wireless equipment revenue was up 9.6% in the fourth quarter.

Wireless service revenue was driven by growth in small and medium business, and enterprise performance improved for the fourth consecutive
quarter and was the highest growth since the start of the pandemic.

While this was partially offset by a decline in public sector due to the elevated distance learning activity in the year ago period, our Verizon Frontline
campaign is resonating with stakeholders, helping drive new customer growth. Wireline trends remain under pressure, as we continue to face prior
year comps that included pandemic buying.

In addition, approximately 1/3 of our declines came from voice services, where we continue to feel the impact of our strategic initiative to exit the
low-margin international wholesale voice market.

Business segment EBITDA was $1.8 billion, down 7.4% from the same quarter last year. Business segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter,
reflecting pressure in legacy wireline products and our commitment to invest in new product growth and drive customer demand for our wireless
solutions. Full year margins were 24.2%, down 120 basis points from last year.

We exited the year with strong momentum in business activity and demand for our wireless products. With the recent launch of our C-band
spectrum, we are in an even better position to serve the 5G needs of our Business customers throughout 2022.

For the quarter, phone gross adds were up approximately 22% year-over-year and 8% from 4Q 2019 levels. The fourth quarter represented the
strongest quarterly phone gross add performance for small and medium business and enterprise since launching Verizon 2.0.

Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, which was up slightly over the prior year. As a result, total postpaid phone net adds were
222,000, our best quarterly performance since the onset of the pandemic.

Now let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. Cash generation remains strong for 2021, as we achieved our financial targets and executed
on our capital allocation plan. We spent over $45 billion on C-band spectrum and expanded our portfolio with the TracFone acquisition, all while
increasing our dividend for the 15th straight year and making progress to maintain a healthy balance sheet.

The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $39.5 billion for the year, a decline of $2.2 billion.
This result primarily reflects strong performance in the business, with increased adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion, offset by higher working capital
from device payment receivables and slightly higher cash taxes.

Capital spending in 2021 totaled $20.3 billion, as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while initiating the first phase of
C-band deployment covering 90 million POPs. C-band-related CapEx was approximately $2.1 billion in 2021. As a result, free cash flow for the full
year was $19.3 billion, down from $23.6 billion in 2020.

The highlights of our financing activity in 2021 was efficiently funding our C-band spectrum investment in the first quarter. Since then, we are
focused on further optimizing our cash position and debt maturity profile, with activity to reduce or extend near-term maturities, while deploying
excess cash to retire longer-dated high-coupon bonds.

We accomplished this while maintaining ample flexibility to invest in our business, such as funding the recent TracFone acquisition. We are also
active with our ABS funding program to finance the increased device payment receivables as consumers upgrade to 5G phones.

We exited the year with $133.7 billion of net unsecured debt, a $3.7 billion reduction from the end of the first quarter. Our unsecured debt to
adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.8x at year-end, in line with our 2021 Investor Day guidance. Our financing activities over the past 2
years have reduced our average portfolio borrowing cost by about 1%, as compared to 2019, albeit with higher debt levels.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Our cash balance at the end of the year was $2.9 billion, down approximately $7.0 billion sequentially, bringing us back to normal levels.

Let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss our outlook for 2022. We have great momentum from the strong operating and financial results last year and
are well positioned heading into the new year, and that momentum is reflected in our guidance for 2022.

We took many strategic actions to position the company for better growth, and our increased guidance disclosures provide greater insight into
our financial outlook. At our Investor Day last year, we provided guidance of at least 3% service and other revenue for 2022 and 2023. For 2022,
we expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3%. On; a reported basis, which includes the net impact of the sale of Verizon Media
Group and our ownership of TracFone, service and other revenue growth is expected to range between 1.0% and 1.5%.

Similarly, on a reported basis, wireless service revenue growth for 2022 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10% driven by growth from our
tiered unlimited strategy, the impact of the TracFone acquisition and the ramping fixed wireless access contribution. Excluding the impact of the
TracFone acquisition, wireless service revenue is expected to grow at least 3%.

We expect total adjusted EBITDA to grow 2% to 3% in 2022 driven by top line growth and ongoing cost discipline. Full year adjusted earnings per
share is expected to be $5.40 to $5.55.

As the waterfall chart shows, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth, including a small positive net contribution from the TracFone and Media
transactions, to be offset by headwinds from below-the-line items. These items include approximately $0.15 from our C-band investment, including
higher depreciation and lower capitalized interest, as we put the spectrum into service; $0.07 share dilution as a result of shares issued in the
TracFone acquisition; and other noncash impacts, such as D&A and pension and OPEB expense.

Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25% based on current legislation.

Capital spending for the full year, excluding C-band, is expected to be between $16.5 billion and $17.5 billion, a decrease from the $18.2 billion in
2021, as we have started our progress towards lower capital intensity. C-band capital spend is anticipated to be between $5 billion to $6 billion,
as we continue to build out the initial markets and begin preparations to deploying Phase II spectrum.

For 2022, cash flow from operations are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by increased working capital from device payment
receivables as well as higher cash taxes.

We are extremely excited for 2022 and expect it to be our biggest year yet. The second wave of 5G is here, and we are leading the way into the
future of connectivity. We have the necessary assets and strategy to unlock the full potential of our growth vectors.

With that, I will hand it over to Hans to discuss our 2022 strategic priorities.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. The assets are in place to make 2022 Verizon's best year yet. Coming off a catalyst year, we are excited to execute on our 5 vectors
of growth and deliver the financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day back in March of last year.

We have clear priorities for the year. We will continue our legacy of disciplined execution and look forward to delivering against our operation and
financial targets that Matt just outlined.

We expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3% in 2022, and we also expect to increase EBITDA by 2% to 3%.

We commit to strengthen and growing our core business and commercializing our unique assets. By combining our Verizon Ultra Wideband with
the new mix and match plans, we can supercharge 5G Ultra Wideband adoption to enhance customer experiences and to increase average revenue
per user.

At the same time, we will continue to expand our fixed wireless access, positioning Verizon as a premier nationwide broadband provider. We
believe that Verizon's fixed wireless access offering will drive the next leg of broadband growth, increasing our market share and reach.

We will innovate in our business to business offerings, bringing mobile edge computing to our enterprise clients and transform the Internet of
Things from a vision to reality. You should continue to expect us to sign new clients and provide examples on how the mobile edge compute is
addressing the complex needs of our customers.

We will benefit from our leading position in the value segment. The integration of TracFone will form the basis of deep and productive relationships
that can grow to meet our customers' changing needs throughout life.

We will continue to run Verizon as a purpose-driven organization. We will pursue C-band and 5G leadership because these technologies are critical
for economic prosperity and driving innovation for all, not just for Verizon. We will continue to serve all of our stakeholders, shareholders, customers,
employees and society. And lastly, I also hope to see you all again at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3.

With that, I hand it back to Brady.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

With regards to the guidance you've given for about 3% growth in service and other revenue, very similar to your growth target for just straight
up wireless service revenue. Could you give us a little more insight as to what you anticipate to be the principal drivers?

In other words, to what extent is this continuing to see people upgrade into higher-tier plans, meaning it's very much an ARPA driven story? And
are we getting to a point where you're expecting a more material contribution in some of those emerging growth opportunities, whether it's fixed
wireless or mobile edge compute?

And then just one more sort of follow-up there on broadband. Now that we're starting to see the fixed wireless net adds begin to ramp, should we
expect that they're going to be the predominant driver of your aggregate broadband net adds going forward? And could you give us some insight
as to where those customers are coming from? In other words, are they primarily Verizon mobile customers taking a bundle? Are you actually
reaching a new demographic?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thank you, Brett. Let me start and I will get some addition from Matt there. When it comes to the growth in 2022, first of all, I think we're
coming in with a great momentum from 2021, both in our Business and in our Consumer units.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Both of them have done a great job at the end of last year topping that, of course, with the C-band launch, which we're very excited about, and
we see a very, very good performance with our new offerings, both on the Business side and the Consumer side, with mix and match and all of
that.

That's all great, of course, for us. What we feel is a great momentum coming into this year. And we also have the step-ups and, as you heard me
and Matt talking, even though we are continuing to step up our customers, we even have more to do there. And we have a couple of years of more
growth coming from that ARPA expansion.

So coming into the year, we feel really good about the momentum we have, but also about opportunity in the market on the wireless market. Matt
will come back.

But on the broadband piece, just quickly then. We, of course, are very excited over the Fios broadband. What we saw last year was the best year
since 2014. We will continue to expand the footprint, and because we have such a good performance on it and customers love it.

And then on top of that, as I said, fixed wireless access is now coming into a totally different model. We have it on 4G. We have it on millimeter
wave. And then, of course, turning on the C-band earlier this month, it just opened up new opportunities for us. Of course, we want to see fixed
wireless access continue to grow for us, and this is a super focus for the team.

And you asked where the customer comes. First of all, all the fixed wireless customers we have, they use this as the primary broadband solution
for them. That's very important because that we see on the usage on them. So it's not a backup, or secondary line on fixed wireless access, it is the
primary broadband usage.

And secondly, these customers are coming from basically cable and DSL areas where they are using that, so that's where we take them from. They
are new to us as broadband customers, and sometimes they are new, new. They're not even wireless customers. So that's where we get them from
right now. So -- and I think that, that's our sweet spot right now when we're a national broadband provider.

So all in all, excited over getting into '22 with all the assets we have right now. And hey, what this talk over the year, we do all of that coming
together so early in the year for us with C-band.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Brett. So just a couple of follow-ups on the service and other revenues. So certainly, we're excited about all the new opportunities
ahead of us, such as fixed wireless, as Hans mentioned, and the other 5 growth vectors. But as you think about 2022, that organic approximately
3% will largely be driven by the momentum we saw coming out of last year.

On the Business side, very strong volumes in the second half of the year in SMB and Global Enterprise. It gives us a great platform to build on. I
would expect the wireless service revenue growth in VBG to be above the 4.8% they did last year at or above that number. So we'll see the benefit
of the strong second half coming through in VBG there.

On the Consumer side, as Hans mentioned, we have approximately 30% of our customers with -- on a premium unlimited tier, so we have the
opportunity to set more customers up. And with the new plans we announced earlier this month, we give customers even bigger reasons for
stepping up to those premium tiers.

So that would be the major drivers of the growth during the year. When we get into the second half of the year, start to see fixed wireless, especially
as that base grows. We'll start to contribute there, but really built on the great momentum we have, coupled with our activities over the past few
weeks, gives us a lot of excitement as we think about '22.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Operator

The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Maybe first follow-up on your subscriber momentum comment Hans. It seems like the industry in the fourth quarter slowed from -- seasonally from
the pace earlier in the year, and you're typically much lower in the first quarter. Any reason to think that isn't the case this year?

And then second, the majority of the C-band deployment looks like it's going to be done this year. And is it fair to assume the remaining $2 billion
to $3 billion happens in 2023? I think, Matt, your comment was that CapEx is beginning to come down on sort of an ex-C-band basis. Should we
assume that next year might be even below this year's sort of $17 billion?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. On the -- compared to the environment, yes, we saw that in the fourth quarter. And when we are saying that we have the guidance for
2022, we continue to believe it's going to be competitive, but we have great assets.

And of course, what is different in the first quarter this year than for many other years is, of course, called 5G Ultra Wideband and C-band. That's a
big difference. We are really excited over that announcement. And as you saw, we now cover more than 95 million POPs, and we have great offerings
both for our Business customers and for our Consumers, and then topping that fixed wireless access and the mobility case.

So -- and later on, we can come to talk about mobile edge compute because this also augment our potential in the mobile edge compute.

Before I let Matt comment on the CapEx, I just want to say what Matt and I said at the Investor Day last year. We're going to see over the years right
now that our capital intensity going down. And partly what you see in the BAU guidance, we do right now.

We have done our fiber for a couple of years. We have done the majority of the long hauls, so to say. And we also see that with the 5G expansion
on C-band, we clearly see over time an offset on the 4G that we can reduce on that. And much of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that is
commonality from the data center to the edge, that also has been ongoing for a while, so that's why we are feeling good about the BAU coming
down.

And then on the C-band, you're absolutely right. $10 billion is the amount we decided, and we told Kyle and the team to spend the faster you can
because we want these assets up and running as soon as possible. And that's what you see the $5 to $6 right now, we do last year.

So that's with a normal calculation that is roughly 2 left in the year to come. But when it comes to future guidance on CapEx, I think we have to
wait for that. But clearly, our target is to continue to be very capital efficient all the time here.

Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, I'll just reiterate a couple of those comments. I mean, absolutely, the -- we're sticking with the $10 billion of incremental. Very pleased with
the aggressive pace that Kyle and team have been able to adopt there, which means that we see those -- what we did last year, plus $5 to $6 this
year, leaves a fairly small amount to come through in 2023.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

After that, the C-band becomes part of our BAU CapEx number as we add capacity to the network. And we -- as Hans mentioned, we've discussed
for a while now the opportunities to see capital intensity come down, and we're starting to see those come through. And they will really accelerate
really up on the back end of '23.

But just one additional item in there. On the One Fiber build we've been doing at the end of 2021, we reached a point where we had just over 50%
of the markets where we have completed the core network build. So there's only success based network build taking place in those 50% of the
market over the course of the next couple of years. We'll completely complete the core build across all One Fiber market.

So you have that, you have the reduction in LTE spend as 5G starts to replace it in terms of carrying large amounts of capacity. Hans mentioned in
his prepared remarks how much of the capacity millimeter wave has really started to pick up as well. And you can see there's a number of reasons
why we feel good about capital intensity going forward here on the BAU.

So we will be in a great place going forward. As you look at the spend for last year on C-band $2.1, that's obviously on a cash basis. On an incurred
basis, the activity in November and December, a large part of that will show up as CapEx in the first quarter here when we pay for those items.

So really strong momentum in terms of what the network team was doing last year. The flywheel is running at full speed now on the C-band build,
and you see that with the activity this month so far.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

If I can follow up, Hans, on something you mentioned. I was thinking about anyway. You said that C-band becomes available, you have a lot of
capacity. And does that change the way you go to market?

Verizon hasn't been tight on capacity, but it hasn't been an excess position in a long time. And now you have all the C-band capacity. Does that
change your desire to go chase market share?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I think this is sort of the full strategy of Verizon coming together. This was what we envisioned when some of us was in a conference room in New
York in 2018 and talking about Verizon intelligent Edge network. I wanted to build that in order to serve a market where capacity and connectivity
is needed all across the network for all type of customers. And clearly, the C-band is just adding enormous lot of capacity for us.

But don't forget the millimeter wave now. I mean, that strategy is really working for us as well because we take a lot of the high-volume areas with
millimeter wave, which unleashed out the spectrum. And hey, we haven't even starting to do a carrier aggregation and using part of our spectrum
yet coming into the 5G.

So I would say, clearly, we will be more aggressive on it, especially on fixed wireless access because we feel so good about the capacity management,
and we have the best engineers in the industry. They have never failed the strategies that were put up.

So I feel really good about our capacity. We can go wherever we want. We have Tami and Manon, the 2 CEOs of our units, going hard on to all the
products we have in all angles of the network. So yes, I think we feel really good about our capacities right now. And what the team is doing is just
amazing.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Continuing on the C-band, first of all, I guess, for Hans, is it safe to say we've got the issues with the FAA behind us? And is there any sort of visibility
on getting that -- the affected spectrum up and running and into production? And I guess a follow-on to that. Has that had any impact on your
business thus far in the year?

And then I guess, following up on Phil's question. I mean, with the additional C-band capacity, should we expect sort of a more immediate change
in trends, either on the mobile or fixed side? And I guess, from an incremental standpoint, did you really see a bigger change on the fixed side?

How do you expect those net adds to ramp? You saw a nice sequential ramp in fixed wireless net adds going from the third quarter to fourth
quarter. Should we expect that to continue as the C-band gets rolled out and your processes to get better and better? Or -- and at what point do
you get to sort of a normalized run rate of fixed wireless sub growth?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. So first of all, on the -- as you heard, our deployment on C-band has been extremely successful, basically deliver a quarter ahead, and
the guys has brought up so much site that's just amazing.

Then you know also that voluntary, we agreed to not turn on some portion of the sites close to the airports, which is a smaller portion of the totality.
I would say this is good progress. Everybody is focused. We have the highest assurance from the White House that this will be resolved very soon.

I follow this personally myself. But again, it's a smaller portion on the network. The big thing is it doesn't impact our business at the moment,
meaning our customers that we can serve. But clearly, we want this to be resolved as soon as possible. So the pressure is on everybody involved
to make this fixed.

When it comes to fixed wireless access, yes, you're right. I mean, we have now, for a couple of years, learned all the way from billing, customer care,
how to work with fixed wireless access. And I think that's a really good way for us to learn going into the second -- or into '22 when it comes to
fixed wireless access. So of course, we have high ambitions internally for fixed wireless access, and the team is really well prepared.

Operator

The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

I was wondering if you could update us on the TracFone integration. What are you seeing so far? And what are the opportunities in '22 and beyond,
particularly the synergy realization, how does that flow into 2022?

And then on the EBITDA, I know, Matt, you mentioned the $10 billion program, and you continue to look at productivity. But how are you thinking
about inflation presumably in retail stores, et cetera? You're facing some wage inflation. But how are you thinking overall about the ability to pull
costs down in this sort of environment?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. I just need to correct myself. It's going so faster. So I said 90 million POPs covered with C-band. We have 95, as I said, as of today. So I just
wanted to correct that. My colleagues here comment that I didn't remember that. It's going fast for us here.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

On TracFone, when we talked about the integration, as we took this over end of November, the team is doing a great job together. What we are
doing from the Verizon side is, of course, bringing our platforms, the network, the products, the experience in IT and all of that. That's what we're
bringing. That's where we bring synergies.

Then, of course, we're going to have these brands serving their market in their way and seeing that we coexist together with them. So that is really
what is bringing out then is some investments in the beginning as we have said. But over time, this should be a really good addition to us, and it
will be incremental from the beginning.

So I'm really excited with TracFone because now we serve the full market and being #1 in that segment as well. So it just plays into the overall
thinking about our 5 vectors of growth, having more places to grow than anybody else in the market, and this is just another vector for us.

Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Simon, on your question around inflation, I mean, the -- as you mentioned, we successfully completed our cost reduction program by the
end of the first quarter, 3 quarters ahead of target. That really puts us in a great place as you think about inflation because we haven't stopped our
work on continuing to get more efficient just because we hit the target, but it really got that muscle developed, and the teams continue to look at
ways to improve our processes, make them more efficient and also improve both the customer and employee experience.

So the teams have continued strong targets in that space as we head into 2022. We all know inflation is out there. And certainly, we'll see some of
that. The good news is that we have a good part of our cost bases tied to longer-term contracts, which means we're not necessarily going to see
the full impact of inflation and at the same pace that other industries are seeing.

But certainly, it's real. We'll take actions to address that. The guidance that we gave was based off our expectation for -- to see an uptick in inflation
this year, and there's a number of levers we have if -- that we can pull if the situation evolves.

Operator

The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

I wanted to -- first question, I wanted to follow up just quick on Simon's question on TracFone. The -- there's really going to be 3 phases, right?
There's going to be the -- getting the handset cost into the hands of the non-Verizon wholesale customers. And then the second is going to be
realizing the margin benefit for migrating those guys onto the network. And then the third piece is going to be kind of grooming those customers
from the prepaid base into the postpaid.

And so I was wondering if you could kind of agree or disagree with that and kind of give a time table where we could start to maybe see those
tailwinds in margins and postpaid phone nets merge.

I think the second question I wanted to ask is just as the fixed wireless access becomes a bigger input to cable, thinking about the competitive
interaction between telco and cable, and it's not fixed wireless access only, it's fiber investments. They are also kind of putting a pincer movement
on them.

And given the maturity of the wireless business now, which has had extraordinarily low churn for a long time, now you're getting the kind of into
year 4. I think we just saw Comcast Xfinity start to offer $400 retention initiatives. Temperature level in cable versus wireless, in particular, is something
of concern.

Could you kind of -- maybe Hans give us your thoughts on how that's going to evolve? And is it going to evolve in a rational way? Or do we need
to be concerned?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I'll start with the second question, and then Matt will walk you through a little bit on TracFone.

Yes, on the market, as I said before, I mean, we compete well in a competitive market, and we prepare ourselves for that. And we think our offerings,
both on wireless and fixed wireless access, including Fios, of course, is very strong.

Ultimately, we have a different recipe than many others. The best network, then we have all our partnerships that nobody else have. And finally,
we have a great value proposition to our customer with mix and match where they can pick and choose. So that's why we feel really good going
into this year.

And with everything we have been doing in the last couple of years, we know it's working. Our strategy is working here. And clearly, we have also
the owner's economics on both wireless and broadband, which is different from anybody else basically, that we actually have this owner because
we have built a network from the data center to the edge with commonality, the same type of equipment. And then at the edge, we decide what
type of access points we have, depending on customer and solutions.

And then we give them different applications and bundles with Disney+, whatever or if there are other solutions. But I think that's unique for us.
We have created that in the last 3 years, and that's why we sit here right now and feeling we're going to compete well in this market, even though
it's competitive.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Dave, on TracFone, so I think as you walk through the things you described there, certainly, over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, we'll have
the ability to bring all of the TracFone base onto the Verizon network, and those customers get that step-up in performance that you would expect
when they come over. So as you recall, roughly 2/3 of the TracFone base was already on the Verizon network, so the other 1/3 will get migrated
there.

The final piece you mentioned was about once you've migrated them over the ability to step them up to postpaid. And look, so those customers
that want to step up to postpaid will be in a great position to do so with, as Hans mentioned, the mix and match structure given the customers
options as they move over to postpaid.

But the TracFone acquisition wasn't based on bringing the ability to move more people over to postpaid. We want to have the best prepaid
propositions in the marketplace. We can complement what was already in place with the owner's economics we have. And so we are in best position
today. For customers who want to stay on prepaid, we're going to have the best offer. For those that want to move to postpaid, we can do that,
too. And just very excited about the opportunities that we now have with the full ownership of the TracFone brand.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

I want to go back to a topic from earlier in the discussion about what's embedded in the '22 guidance. Specifically, what's the expectation for
wireless postpaid industry phone growth in '22 and how that compares to '21? And how important is the industry growth in '22 in terms of volume
for Verizon to hit the financial objectives that are set?

And then just separately, Hans, you made a mention of the macro mobile edge compute earlier. I'm just curious if there's an update to unpack the
financial opportunities and contributions from that arena for Verizon.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll start with the mobile edge compute. Now, as you have seen, we have a great progress on that. First of all, we have 3 different business cases
on the same infrastructure again. We have the private mobile edge compute. We have the public mobile edge compute. And we have 5G network.

That's what we're working on right now, and they are a little bit different use cases, of course, of all of them. Some are a little bit more B2B to C and
some are really B2B.

What we are doing right now is, of course, bringing all that live together with our partners, and we have the 3 largest web-scale players in the
industry working with us on all of this. And suddenly, we start seeing, with every announcement that you see in the market, if it's IoT solutions or
metaverse solution, I mean, that's what we built the network in mobile edge compute. So this year, I'm looking for taking many of our proof-of-concept
together with large enterprises and application developers to commercial deals.

If you would put that in timing, I would say the fixed wireless access is a little bit earlier, as we said all the time. The mobility case is first on 5G, then
fixed wireless access, and we talked a lot about that and then mobile edge compute.

So you're going to see more about us gaining and winning a lot of businesses because we are the only one in the market in the mobile edge
compute. So that's what you're going to see in '22. And then, of course, we're going to build up our revenue base going into '23.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Mike, on your first question around the guidance on the revenue, so specifically, is it from a volume standpoint? When I look at the business segment,
we saw very strong performance by that group in the second half of the year. We're excited about the momentum they have. We assume that they
will continue to perform strongly from that standpoint into 2022, and as you heard earlier, expect them to be at least at the service revenue growth
from '21 or above. So that will be driven by continued strength in SMB and Global Enterprise.

And then on the Consumer side, we assume that the switcher pool will continue to be constrained based off the activity in the marketplace. We
will continue to be very strong in terms of customer retention, and we have the opportunity to step customers up.

And you saw us do that last year. And now we have the additional opportunities that come with that, with the new mix and match plans on C-band.
So we have great opportunity there.

But as I say, we assume the switcher pool will continue to be -- continue to show some limitations just because of some of the other activity out
there. But even with that, we think we'll have very strong service revenue growth next year. And then we bring fixed wireless access on top of that,
as you think about getting into the back end of the year in subsequent periods. So very excited about the momentum that we see from a revenue
standpoint.

Operator

The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen.

Greg Williams - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - Director

It's Greg Williams sitting in for Colby. Two questions, if I may. One is on your 2022 free cash flow. I realize you're not guiding to it. But with EBITDA
guiding up 2% to 3% and CapEx, call it, $22.5 billion at the midpoint, we see free cash flow coming in around $20 billion to $21 billion.

Obviously, the big bogey here is CapEx. The ranges could be up to $2 billion, including C-band. Can you help us with the proper framework on the
free cash flow set up in '22, the puts and takes, the working capital you mentioned working capital drag on 5G phones? What could that drag be?
And pension and how we should think about it?

Then the second question just on rising rates. With the expectations of the 10-year eclipsing 2%, how do rising rates change your view on capital
allocation and your leverage target?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So thanks for the questions, Greg. So on the free cash flow for 2022, it starts with the strong cash generation from the business with the EBITDA,
and you saw the EBITDA guide, plus 2% to 3%, driven from growth at the top line. That puts us in a good place.

But I do expect we'll see working capital increase next year as we continue to support our customer activity, especially related to the device payment
plans. Also as revenues and profitability increases, cash taxes have a nasty habit of increasing as well. So that will, of course, be in the CFFO.

And then as you get down to free cash flow, as you mentioned, the CapEx will play in there. We said last year we'd spend that incremental $10
billion over 3 years. We're going to see the biggest part of that come through this year.

But you're also seeing the rest of the CapEx number being lower year-over-year. That range of $16.5 million to $17.5 million versus $18.2 billion,
we've done not just last year, but the last 2 years. So you'll see that come through.

And really kind of linking that with your second question, but what you really see is our ability to execute across all parts of the capital allocation
model, invest in the business with the -- not just the buying the spectrum, but accelerating the deployment of it, investing in TracFone, at the same
time increasing the dividend for the 15th year in a row, continuing to strengthen the balance sheet.

We said at the Investor Day last year our leverage ratio would be about 2.9x at the end of first quarter with all the financing for the spectrum, and
we'd be at 2.8x by the end of the year. We hit that target. So you see already coming down while doing that additional spend. So certainly excited
about the opportunities that the cash generation of the business give us.

And then as you think about rising rates, the team has done a great job of maximizing the debt portfolio. You see that in the interest expense. The
majority of our debt is fixed rate, so it would take interest rates being at elevated levels for a long time period for that to flow through into our debt
complex.

So I think the way that we're managing the debt profile means that the higher rate environment will not cause us to change how we think about
capital allocation model here. And certainly, we're focused on continuing to execute aggressively against all of the pillars of the model.

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder & Founding Partner

I want to return to some of the comments you made about fixed wireless. How should we think about fixed wireless? Is it primarily an opportunity
to generate revenue on the 5G platform because it's available? Or is it primarily a play toward convergence and selling a bundle of wireless and
home access across not just your wireline footprint, but across the whole country?

And sort of on that latter point, how do you envision the sale evolving? Do you expect that a converged offering to households is going to become
the norm for the industry?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you for the question. First of all, I think what we have designed this network and our go-to-market is optionality for our customers. If the
market goes to more convergence, definitely, we will be there. We're going to be nationwide with broadband, and we're going to be nationwide
with wireless.

If a standalone business, we can do that as well because we have the scale right now, all the way from our network to our capacity, to our IP, to our
go-to-market, customer care, all the way we have scale. So we are just playing with the -- where the market is going and giving the optionality.

The same goes for our content deals. I mean, trying to see that our customers can pick and choose what they want and see if they want it. They
can keep it or they can continue with it.

So all in all, with our mix and match, our network, everything is set up for optionality of customer choice. We are the company that can give some
customer choice, and then we have economies of scale in either of the solution.

So if the market go convergence, we're going to be there. If it's go separate, we're going to be there, and we're going to have economies of scales
of both of them. And it will increase our leverage when it comes to profitability because it's one network, it's one way to go to the market for us
regardless of.

Operator

The next question is from Peter Supino of Bernstein.

Peter Supino - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Research Analyst

Two questions, if I could. Matt, I'd love to hear a bit more about the 2022 guidance for organic service revenue growth of 3% relative to EBITDA
growing just a little bit slower. I'm wondering where the deleverage is in the model for 2022 and when you might expect to see the operating
leverage that you mentioned in your prepared remarks.

And then Hans, just to follow up on Craig's question about fixed wireless access. You're in the last year of using EDLP broadly in Fios and then
providing 50% off of fixed wireless access for Verizon premium unlimited.

And so it seems like your marketing is behaving in a way that's very focused on driving bundling ratios. I'm wondering if you think that's the right
interpretation. And if it is, when might you be more focused on pricing in the broadband business?

JANUARY 25, 2022 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2021 Verizon Communications Inc. Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Peter, so I'll start off with the -- taking a look at your question around the '22 guidance. So certainly expect wireless service revenue to have another
good year starting with the momentum we have coming out of '21, both in Business and in Consumer. And then we add obviously to that bringing
TracFone in and also with the C-band and the new mix and match pricing, so we feel good there.

We would expect in the legacy wireline business to see the -- some of the secular trends that we've been experiencing for a number of years now
continue, providing an offset in there. And you see the impact of that also as you think about the profitability.

But certainly, the 2% to 3% on EBITDA we think is -- shows that the business continues to grow, continues to increase the cash generation. And as
we bring C-band online and execute across all 5 vectors of growth, we have opportunities to see that margin line expand even further in subsequent
years as we go here.

So the margin growth, the cash flow growth across the business should continue to be strong not just in '22, but for a number of years out.

Hans, do you want to speak to fixed wireless?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes, I will answer on the fixed wireless access. First of all, I think we have not changed our long-term strategy to be financial disciplined when it
comes to our customer acquisitions. We are focused on high-quality customers, and we will continue to do so.

Our team is extremely methodical when it comes to do these offerings and see the long-term benefit for us and for the customer and what we give
them.

As I said, right now, in our fixed wireless access, we have this bundle to see if that is what the market wants to have. But again, we have optionality
with the pricing. We can do it standalone or we can do it together with our premium on wireless.

And I think all in all, again, we have owner's economics on both of them, so it should be possibly financially for us. And again, the team is very
convinced that we have a really, really good formula here.

And I have all the confidence in my Consumer team, but don't forget the Business team. The Business team is doing fixed wireless access as well,
and they're doing mobility as well, and they have a great opportunity. Again, we use our platforms, the long-term strategy we have put in, in order
to be using sort of the same type of solutions to our customer base and that we can scale, and that's why we can do the guidance we do right now
for 2022 and feeling good about it.

Operator

Your final question for today will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

Can we talk about the C-band build out a little bit more? The $10 billion in total spend, will you have basically all your cell sites built with that is
done? And will all the spectrum be online?

And I guess, that's the same question for the 95 million POPs. So you have most of the cell sites built in those locations. And maybe what percentage
of the spectrum is online?

And then on the C-band, can you give us an idea now that you're operating and what the increase in overall capacity is? The latency maybe, other
measurements would be helpful.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I'll let Matt start because I forgot the many questions. I have so many things in my head.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Tim, so on the C-band build, so look, certainly, we are not complete with coverage from a build standpoint with the initial $10 billion. The $10
billion is incremental. As I said, once we've spent the $10 billion, ongoing C-Band build becomes part of our BAU CapEx. And you heard our comments
earlier around expectation for continued improved capital intensity.

So -- but certainly, within the $10 billion is helping us build out significant parts of the first 46 markets, the ones we got access to and turned on
last week and also begin the early build in the other markets that are scheduled be turned on in December of '23.

So we'll get a substantial part of the coverage for C-Band built with the $10 billion, certainly not the whole thing. But then as we do that, traffic
moves off of the LTE network so our need to continue to spend on capacity and the LTE network comes down, that's how we'll continue to fund
the C-band build going forward as a result of those other efficiencies. So hopefully, that provides a little more detail.

Hans, if you have any...

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

No. The only addition I would do is, of course, that when it comes to this initial build, I mean, the vast, vast majority is on sites we already have. We
have said it before, it's the same grid as the 4G, which is great for us and how we do this. And then we have normal expansions over time, but that's
nothing unusual. It's BAU.

When it comes to the performance of the C-band, this is a perfect sort of cliff hanger. It's a little bit early. Of course, we're excited, but we have
Investor Day 3rd of March. And I think that if we tune in there, you'll probably get something about the performance on our C-band.

But early into it, I'm really pleased what the technology team have done and our partners have done so far. But stay tuned for 3rd of March, and
we will talk more about that.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Yes. Thanks, Tim. That's a great way to end. Brad, that's all the time we have today.

JANUARY 24, 2023 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2022 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Slide 3 shows a summary of our results. Consolidated total operating revenue was $35.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 3.5% year-over-year.
Wireless service revenue grew 5.9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, benefiting from unlimited plan migrations, our best fourth quarter total
postpaid net additions in 7 years, pricing actions that we began implementing in June of 2022 and a full quarter contribution from TracFone.

Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $11.7 billion for the fourth quarter, down 0.2% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset by
higher promotional expense, declines in our high-margin legacy wireline business and inflationary cost pressures. Adjusted earnings per share in
the fourth quarter was $1.19, a decrease of 10.5% compared to the similar period in 2021, driven by higher interest expense, depreciation and
lower pension-related income. Finally, we delivered $14.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2022 and exited the year with a net unsecured
debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone. On today's earnings call, I will focus on our strategy, guidance, expectation for the business and
why I'm so excited about the opportunities for the year ahead.

Let me start by saying that we delivered against all of our revised financial targets provided in July, including 8.6% wireless service revenue growth,
$47.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $5.18. I'm pleased that the momentum built during the third quarter continued
into the fourth quarter.

Last quarter, we set the expectation of a positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter, and we delivered against that expectation.
Although we have more work to do, I'm encouraged by the improvement and expect to build on the momentum in 2023. The improvement in the
consumer performance was complemented by yet another strong mobility quarter in Verizon Business Group as well as continued success in fixed
wireless access with net adds up sequentially in both consumer and business. Together with Fios result, we added 416,000 broadband subscribers
in the quarter, our best total broadband performance in over a decade, and approximately 1.3 million total broadband net adds for the year.

Regarding our guidance, we have positioned ourselves to improve on our performance in 2023 and expect to build a good underlying operational
momentum, although that will be offset by the impact of the noncash factors such as promo amortization in our revenue growth and adjusted
EBITDA. Additionally, we're seeing some impact of high interest rates. At the same time, we expect our capital spending to reduce significantly in
2023 as we reach the end of our incremental C-Band spending, which will be a tailwind for free cash flow. We're striving to make further improvements
and take even more action that will ultimately lead to better performance than the guidance we have outlined today. Matt will discuss the guidance
in more detail later in the call.

The industry enters 2023 with continued macroeconomic uncertainty as elevated inflation and interest rates impact the broader economy. Still,
demand for our service remains strong, given the growing importance of mobility and broadband to both consumers and businesses. The
combination of our network reliability, diverse portfolio of products and services and the industry's strongest customer base provides us the
flexibility to meet the changing customer needs even in a difficult economic environment.

We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders by our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Taking these 3
metrics together is how we hold ourselves accountable. We are well positioned to improve our performance and accelerate growth on a go-forward
basis with network quality as the foundation for our strategy and growth. We expect that wireless mobility and nationwide broadband will be the
most significant contributors to Verizon's growth for the next several years. In 2022, we made important progress in each of these businesses. Our
growth in these areas will be driven by extending our network advantage using our C-Band spectrum, which we expect will strengthen our network
leadership in the coming years.

We are taking a balanced approach on how we run our business. Adding the right customers and generating ongoing profits from them is how
we maximize value. We remain focused on our cost reduction and efficiency actions while also maximizing our return on invested capital via better
monetizing our assets to put us on track to improve free cash flow going forward. We're proud of being the strongest in the industry in terms of

generating cash and want to preserve that while also continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We're executing with discipline and will continue
driving a strategy which produces sustainable, long-term growth and profitability.

As connectivity plays an increasingly important role for consumers and businesses, it is the quality of the connectivity that matters the most. Not
all networks are architected and built the same nor have the same quality. We have seen these differences in the past and expect that 5G will be
no different. Our engineers have the best track record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will
continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity where needed and filling service gaps where they exist
even as capital intensity declines in the coming years.

In the shift to 5G, we have been rapidly building out our C-Band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our company's history.
We are tracking to 200 million POPs this quarter and are well ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POPs targeted by year-end 2024. C-Band
propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale
C-Band quickly and efficiently, including in the 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-Band spectrum later this year.

Due to the timing of spectrum availability, our deployment strategy targets the highest usage areas first with the capability to deliver the most
distinguished experience in places where the majority of our customers consume mobile services. As additional spectrum is cleared, we will have
access to many new markets. As with prior generations of wireless technology, customers in all areas can expect to receive the best network
experience.

And where we have built out the C-Band, we're only getting started. Early deployments have been limited to 60 megahertz or 100 megahertz in
some early clearance markets. Consumer performance in these markets has been encouraging as evidenced by better retention, more favorable
gross add trends and higher premium uptake. In addition, the majority of our consumer fixed wireless net adds are on C-Band. With the final tranche
of spectrum expected to be available in late 2023, we can deploy an average of 161 megahertz and up to 200 megahertz in certain markets across
the entire continental U.S.

When we turn on the full breadth of spectrum, we expect peak download speeds to reach 2.4 gigabits per second, up from the 900 megabits per
second we see with 60 megahertz deployed, all while supporting far more users and applications. At the same time, we're also deploying our 5G
stand-alone core. So by the end of the year, you should see a network with incredible speeds, both downlink and uplink, and positioned to deliver
5G capabilities such as network slicing, voice over 5G NR, among others.

We believe our network will allow us to maintain our premium position with our wireless mobility customers and provide reliable fixed wireless
access services to consumers and businesses across the country. This is an example of how we can monetize our multipurpose network by scaling
several revenue streams on the same infrastructure to enhance our return on investment. We're adding far more capacity to our network than the
peak usage increase we're expecting in fixed wireless markets. We continue to expect that we'll have 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless subscribers
by the end of 2025, and those subscribers will be enabled by our current build and capital plans.

Our mobility and broadband plans are supported by our deep fiber position and ongoing fiber investments. Approximately 50% of our sites are
now served by our own fiber, up from 45% last year. We believe we are the only provider serving that level of its wireless network with its own
fiber. This supports superior quality of service and end-to-end owners' economics. That means better reliability and higher margins and look for
us to continue to expand the percentage of sites on our own fiber. We also expanded our Fios footprint by over 550,000 locations in 2022, extending
our Fios open for sales to more than 17 million locations. You can expect continued fiber expansion in the years ahead.

In summary, network quality is the foundation for our strategy and growth, and all of the moves we are making are focused on ensuring we continue
our network leadership in the future.

As I mentioned earlier, Verizon's success should be measured against 3 important metrics: service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Let me now
cover each of these in detail and tell you why I'm so confident in our ability to deliver against all 3 of these benchmarks.

JANUARY 24, 2023 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2022 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

We expect that our network differentiation will be the cornerstone of our service revenue growth and that it will allow us to continue to attract
the highest quality customer base in the industry and maintain our market-leading share of the B2B market. Our fixed wireless access is also expected
to contribute more meaningfully to service revenue as we enter the year growing rapidly with a base of more than 1.4 million subscribers. 2022
demonstrated to us that we need to be even more agile and responsive in the consumer market. This is one of the reasons I assumed leadership
of the business late last year. We are moving into 2023 with momentum and expectation for improved performance based on recent actions and
planned initiatives.

After integrating TracFone over the last year, we now have a full complement of offerings from entry-level prepaid all the way up to premium
unlimited postpaid plans for the first time in our history. This will enable us to better attract new customers while also retaining customers through
their mobile journey. You have already seen us take more segmented approach to the market through the Welcome Unlimited and One Unlimited
plans in postpaid and the launch of Total by Verizon in prepaid. We're already seeing the benefits from these actions.

In 2023, our plans will continue to evolve as we look for the best ways to cater to our customers, whether through network experience, content or
other product offerings. Each new offering gives us an opportunity to engage with the prospective customers and ensure they receive the plan
that best fits their needs. We remain disciplined around our core pricing and continue to perform well with our premium customers on retention
and step-up activity. As we move into 2023, we're taking a more localized approach with our network and go-to-market strategy, providing greater
autonomy to the teams on the front line and speeding up the pace of decision-making. This will allow us to compete more effectively across
geographies, particularly where dynamics may differ by individual market.

Finally, we continue to revise our sales compensation structure, ensuring we have the right incentives in place to drive sales growth. The customers
we have and continue to attract represent the highest quality customer base in the industry. Based on our customer payment patterns, which are
at or better than pre-pandemic levels, and the low delinquency rates in our securitized device payment plan portfolios, we continue to see only a
limited impact from the macroeconomic environment on our customers. While we are watching this closely, we have a lot of confidence in the
resilience of our customer base.

Scaling of new business such as private 5G networks and edge computing will also be a strategic focus in 2023. Our funnel is strong, and we are
making the appropriate investments to ensure such services provide a meaningful contribution to future growth in the years ahead, which
differentiates us in the industry.

You can expect Verizon to compete, but I want to underline again that we will not sacrifice financials for volumes. We continue to focus on improving
our cost of acquisition and retention and believe current promotional incentives are not sustainable for the industry in the long run. Although we
have participated, to some extent, in this dynamic, expect us to pursue more ways to move away from the aggressive handset subsidies with offers
like Welcome Unlimited plan, which offers attractive headline pricing for customers while reducing device subsidies. We manage the business for
profitability, and such actions drive healthy lifetime value for the business.

Moving to Business wireline. We're taking several actions to reduce the financial impact of the unit and are scaling back on pursuing low margin
revenue in order to again drive improved profitability. While this may result in missing out on some revenue, it is the right move and one that will
lead to higher margin and cash flow over time. At the same time, we are focused on further improving the cost structure through greater efficiencies.

You may recall that we embarked on a new cost-cutting initiative late last year. A component of this initiative is the formation of Verizon Global
Services. This organization is accelerating efforts to drive cross-functional efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest savings in network superiority and
customer growth while contributing to long-term profitability. Additional opportunity exists in sourcing, sales and marketing and corporate system,
among others. The heavy lifting is now underway as we execute against our goal to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of run rate savings by 2025. So
our EBITDA strategy is clear: grow profitable volumes in both Consumer and Business based on our increasingly differentiated network and manage
our expenses the way you would expect us to do.

By growing service revenue and EBITDA, we believe that we will be able to provide our shareholders with increasingly healthy free cash flow, which
will support the strength of our balance sheet and fund our dividend growth. Our current streak of raising the dividend 16 years in a row is unmatched

in the industry, and we intend to be able to continue that trend. Because our mobility and fixed wireless access products leverage the same
infrastructure, they provide a capital-efficient path to future cash flow growth.

We believe that we will become increasingly efficient with our capital, using less capital to generate every dollar of revenue for years to come. That
will enable us to produce expanding cash flow that we can both reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders.

And as you know, we're doing all of this as our capital spending budget is expected to decline from $23.1 billion in 2022 to under $19 billion at the
midpoint of our guidance range this year, a reduction of nearly 20% year-over-year. In 2024, we expect our CapEx to be around $17 billion, which
we expect to represent the lowest capital intensity in over a decade and among the lowest in the industry. We expect we will deliver a best-in-class
network experience while reducing our 2022 CapEx levels by more than $5 billion over the next couple of years.

With that, I turn it over to Matt to discuss guidance.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hans, and good morning. I want to spend some time walking you through our 2023 guidance while also commenting on our longer-term
outlook.

Our 2023 guidance reflects momentum we have exiting 2022, which we expect to drive wireless service revenue growth. For 2023, we expect total
wireless service revenues to grow between 2.5% and 4.5%, driven by increased penetration of premium unlimited plans, scaling of fixed wireless,
continued growth in products and services such as content and device protection plans and the full year impact of our pricing actions taken in
2022.

As noted in our earnings materials, our wireless service revenue growth outlook includes an approximately 190 basis point benefit from a larger
allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees, which partially recover network operating costs to wireless service revenue from other
revenue. In addition, we expect promo amortization to be approximately $1 billion higher than last year.

We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within a range of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue
offset by wireline and other revenue declines and higher marketing and network operating expenses.

Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.55 to $4.85. As noted on our third quarter earnings call, high interest rates are expected
to result in approximately $0.25 to $0.30 of interest expense pressure in 2023 due to higher floating rate debt costs and higher securitization costs
for our growing device payment portfolio.

We continue to believe we have the right debt structure for the long term and have managed the balance sheet appropriately by keeping short-term
maturities to a minimum in this higher interest rate environment. Higher rates for pension and OPEB, in addition to the lower pension asset base
resulting from negative returns in 2022, are also expected to impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.15 compared to 2022. This
flows through other income and expense in our income statement. Finally, we expect approximately $0.03 to $0.05 of impact from higher depreciation
expense, primarily driven by the C-Band equipment being put into service across '22 and into '23.

Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.0% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full
year is expected to be between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, including the final approximately $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion of
C-Band-related capital spending. And we continue to expect total capital spending to be approximately $17 billion in 2024. The reduction from
the $23.1 billion CapEx in 2022 is expected to drive higher free cash flow in 2023 despite increases in cash interest and cash taxes. As previously
discussed, we will complete our accelerated $10 billion C-Band program this year, after which all C-Band capital expenditures will be part of our
business-as-usual capital program.

JANUARY 24, 2023 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2022 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Looking beyond 2023, given our exit rate from 2022, we don't expect to hit the long-range outlook as we projected at the Investor Day last year.
However, due to the way we have positioned our network and service offerings coming into 2023, we do expect increasing growth in revenue and
cash flow in subsequent years.

I will now turn it back over to Hans.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Matt. Let me summarize the Verizon opportunity in a few key points. We are making the necessary improvements to drive better
performance. We have the best network, and it's only getting better even as capital intensity improves. We have the largest EBITDA base in the
industry and a clear path to free cash flow expansion. And finally, we have one of the most attractive dividends in the market, and we intend to be
able to continue the trend of growing the dividend each year.

By that, I hand it over to Brady to start the Q&A.

Brady Connor - Verizon Communications Inc. - SVP of IR

Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD

I had a couple of questions on the guidance. The first one is, how are you thinking about your confidence and the visibility of this guide as compared
to a year ago? Obviously, we'd had the war and stuff like that. But I think the reductions in guidance, obviously, were a concern for investors. So as
you went through this process, was it deliberate conservatism that you were trying to bake in to make sure that you could hit, and I think, Hans,
you might have mentioned, exceed the guidance with additional steps? So that kind of setup would be great.

And then I guess for Matt, you called out some of the pressures on the bottom line. But you had a $0.30 range on your EPS guide. I think it was
$0.15 a year ago. And it sounded like on the items you gave, the range wasn't that wide. So perhaps you can just give us some color on what caused
you to be as wide this year on the EPS.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Simon. I can start. I mean, when it comes to the guidance, I mean, we -- of course, it's a little bit uncertain, as we said, coming into the
year. But we are laser focused on the service growth and on the EBITDA expansion and hence, also the cash flow expansion. That's how we are
running our business, and that's how we take decisions. And as I said, I mean, our job is, of course, to see that we are meeting or exceeding the
guidance we have given out. And that's how we're going to work all the year. And our teams are set up to work like that. We are in the beginning
of the year, so we're going to see how it turns out.

But clearly, we are super laser-focused in the whole company, how we're executing right now and how it hangs together. And as I said before, we
have now all the assets, all the way from the network to our -- to the prepaid, to the postpaid, all that. And from us, it's a lot of execution in a
competitive market. But we definitely believe we can compete very well in that market. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Simon. So look, as you think about the guide for the year, obviously, there's a number of items in there. As I think about the range, we can
get to the top end of the range there with strong execution, the activity around the cost program scaling, that flywheel moving faster than our
base assumption and just if we see more volumes come through the business there. Obviously, the low end will reflect the promo environment,
the overall competitive environment. And then we'll see items like inflation and so on.

So the range of the EPS guide, I think very similar to the EBITDA guide that we've given. And I think it reflects, as we come into this year, when you
think about some of the unknowns that will play out here in the macro environment and the competitive environment, we feel it's the right range
to have for 2023. As Hans said, there's a lot of things for us to stay focused on and make sure we produce the best result possible.

Operator

The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD, Sector Head of the United States Communications Group and Telco & Pay TV Analyst

Can we talk about consumer margins within the guidance? They were down about almost 400 basis points in '22. And Matt and Hans, you guys
gave some good color on some puts and takes around promotions, around Verizon Global Services and I think, I guess, higher marketing and
network operation cost. But I guess any other puts and takes to call out?

And as we look into '23, as part of the guidance, should we expect the consumer margins to sort of flatten here? And do you guys have visibility
that as you guys -- a lot of these initiatives take hold that we can start to see some improving margins on the consumer side?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. I mean, I can start. I mean, of course, we're doing quite a lot in the consumer segment right now, all the way from addressing areas
where we have softness in our portfolio with Welcome, for example, in order to create growth. But also, we are regionalizing our business, both
on the network side and the consumer side in order to take quicker decision. But also, the network is so strong in local markets where we're building
out the C-Band, we want to take advantage of that. And as we said before, we have the chance to -- or we don't have the chance. We see the
correlation between C-Band deployment and step-ups and, of course, fixed wireless access and the majority of our fixed wireless access customers
coming on C-Band right now. So that's why.

And finally, we have also worked with the spending, the consumer investment, I call it, all the way what we're doing above the line on promo, what
we're doing below the line on retention and how much we do in media. We're doing that much more agile. I think that will help us to manage and
continue our clear path and a clear target of growing our top line and expanding our EBITDA. That's our job. Then there are some headwinds that
Matt has talked about. But obviously, the underlying should be improving with the cost cuts and the way we're working in the consumer group.
Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans. John, so as you think about the year-over-year reduction in '22, remember at the start of the year, we said that we expected
about a 200 basis point impact because of the inclusion of TracFone in the business for the year, obviously, accretive in absolute terms. But from

a margin standpoint, we did expect to see that. So then obviously, there's some other items in there. We talked a little bit about the inflation impact
last year, obviously, the competitive environment and the promo piece in there as well.

So there will be some things that we have the opportunity to improve on this year. Synergies from within TracFone as we move more customers
over to our own network will be an upside. But then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, obviously, the promo amortization is expected to
be up on a year-over-year basis as the delay between being at these higher levels from a cash basis and then that flowing through on an accounting
basis. So when you net those things out, expect something initially on a -- probably a similar type of level in '23 to '22 with some opportunities to
push that as we go forward into subsequent years.

Operator

The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.

Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst

I'm actually going to stick with consumer. And I was hoping we can get a little more insight into 2 different tools you're using to go to market. The
first is Welcome Unlimited. You've been advertising it quite a bit, and you've mentioned it a couple of times during your prepared remarks. I'm
wondering to what extent are you finding that Welcome Unlimited is indeed a popular plan with new consumers versus the extent to which it's
driving wireless shoppers into your channels where you're actually more frequently converting them into a higher-tiered plan? So that's the first
question.

And then it seems like you have been reluctant to make greater use of device promos. Obviously, you were using them to some extent last year.
How are you thinking about the role of device promos as you go to market this year and you look to sort of sustain these positive consumer phone
net adds?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thanks. The Welcome Unlimited is working exactly as we wanted. I mean, it creates store traffic. We bring our customers in, and we see that the
customer gets the plans they want. We have not seen any step-downs that is coming from that. We are more seeing an opportunity for our customers
to have a conversation with them. And of course, remember, that's a bring your own device. It's for 4 lines, and that's the way we have been dealing.

And we learned a lot from the first Welcome we started with somewhere in the third quarter, I remember or beginning of -- end of the second
when we saw a little bit -- and that was an area where we were soft. And that's where we clearly saw that customers were going to others. These,
we now have diverted, and they come to us. And if you then add that, you see our premium unlimited continue to do well. We went up now to
45% actually from 41% in the third quarter, I think. So we added 4% more on unlimited premium. So that is working for us. We just need to be agile,
stay close to see which segment and then be aggressive in the segment we need. And the segment we're performing well in, we let them continue
to perform well.

And when it comes to device promos, yes, we understand that's part of the competition -- I mean, part of the market. We will be a part in that as
well. But we will continue to be cautious and see that we actually are using device promos in the right moment for the right customers. And you
saw us last year coming in and out. Sometimes we're a little bit more aggressive. And others, we were actually the least aggressive. And I think
that's how we will continue this year, depending on where the market is going.

But what you can expect from us in the consumer unit is to be agile, take quick decisions and see if they're working, then we'll continue. If they're
not working, we're pulling them. That's why I'm into this basically every day myself nowadays. And I think this has proven that we get the momentum
with the team, and the team is actually executing well. We have more to do. I mean, I always say that. I mean, it's going to take a long time before
I feel that I'm 100% satisfied or happy. But definitely, it's work to do here, but I've seen the good momentum.

Operator

The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.

Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst

Sticking with wireless. On service revenue, when I pull out the definition change from other to service revenue, you're guiding to roughly 1% to
2% wireless service revenue growth in '23, which is a big deceleration from almost 6% this quarter. How should we think about this in regards to
phone adds and ARPU and the impact of promotions on service revenue? Can you just put the pieces together for us? And do you expect that
service revenue will stay positive each quarter this year or actually flips to negative at some point?

And just on top of that, typically, we see things much slower in terms of subscribers from 4Q to 1Q. While I don't expect you to guide on subscribers,
do you think we'll see sort of typical seasonality this quarter? Or do you anticipate sort of better performance?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can start, and then Matt can break down the numbers you're talking about. I mean, yes, we -- on the premium segment, there is seasonality in the
first quarter, and I don't think that's going to be different this year. However, our work is to keep up the momentum that we had from the fourth
quarter into this year, where we had good store traffic year, quarter-over-quarter and also high conversion rate. But it also means that we need to
be agile and see what's happening in the market. And it's a little bit early to do any guidance or something like that, which we're not doing on net
adds. But clearly, there is going to be seasonality. But we have good momentum. And we're going to continue to execute and be very close to the
market. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Phil, so kind of unpacking some of the piece parts of your question there. So seasonality, absolutely, we expect that to look reasonably as you
would expect throughout the year from an overall standpoint.

In terms of the service revenue guide, your math there is correct. When you think about the fourth quarter, you said close to 6%, remember that
included a full quarter of owning Trac in 4Q this year versus only part of 4Q last year. So as we get into '23, finally on a year-over-year basis to talk
about stuff on an apples-to-apples basis and not with and without M&A items, which is nice. So once you remove that, very similar.

In terms of the piece parts within wireless service revenue guide, think about you got the positive impacts of the price ups. Obviously, we had 6
months' impact last year, approximately. You get a full year impact this year, also the benefit of the FWA momentum we had and having 1.4 million
subscribers in the base at the start of this year that we're billing throughout the year. But that's offset by the promo amortization, which, as I
mentioned in the up-front comments, will be higher in the income statement year-over-year with the timing of the recognition of that and then
also the impact of the volumes last year offsetting some of the ARPA benefit we had.

So the task for the team going forward is to continue the momentum that we started to see in the second half of last year, as Hans mentioned. And
that will put us in a position to continue to push service revenue in a positive direction going forward.

JANUARY 24, 2023 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2022 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

David Barden - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD

The first one, maybe, Matt, could we refresh the free cash flow outlook for 2023? I think the midpoint was $21 billion for 2023 from last year's Analyst
Day. I think if we look at the EBITDA guidance, which is roughly flat, interest expense guidance, which is up $1 billion, the CapEx, which is down $4
billion, it feels like it should be roughly $17 billion, unless there's other things in taxes and working capital related to some of these promotions.
So if you could kind of refresh that a little bit, that would be awesome.

And then Hans, you called out 3 things as it relates to the C-Band deployment. And this has been a big success for Verizon is getting this build
done. I think that some people have been asking themselves like where the return is from all the money that's been spent. And you highlighted
higher retention, better gross adds and higher premium take rate. Are there numbers that you can put around that, that we could grab on to and
say, "When, in 2024, Verizon doubles their footprint in C-Band with the new spectrum getting cleared, we can put a number on that and say, 'This
is going to be the return that Verizon gets from this build?'"

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Why don't you start, Matt, and I take the second question on the C-Band.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So on the free cash flow, David, obviously, last year, we said that we expect -- you had the right number, the expectation of where we said free
cash flow might be for '23. As I think about where we see the business today versus where it was a year ago, a couple of factors that are different.
You have CapEx very much in line with where we thought it would be at this point. The team did a great job last year deploying C-Band. And
obviously, we spent most of the $10 billion. So you get a nice year-over-year benefit.

Offsetting that, cash taxes will be higher this year as we have less benefit from a higher CapEx number and also bonus depreciation dropping down.
That was in our expectation last year. Interest rates were obviously very different than we expected last year, you touched on those. And then the
jump-off point from the EBITDA in the business at the end of '22 to '23, lower than we hoped to be at the Investor Day a year ago. So you've got
the right moving parts there.

We're not guiding specifically to a cash flow number. We historically haven't, but you've got the right moving pieces in there. So net-net, the CapEx
reduction year-over-year gives us a good tailwind to think about cash flow for this year. So with that, I'll hand you to the C-Band question.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Yes. And it's, of course, a focus for us to continue to grow the cash flow, as we have said so many times. So we will continue on that work.

When it comes to the C-Band, first of all, we have said from the beginning, the C-Band acquisition we did is a multi-decade spectrum. It's going to
-- in so much and in so many years. And of course, that was a deliberate decision because we believe we're going to be in wireless business for the
eternity of Verizon's history. So that's very important.

However, when it comes to the impacts, and I think I mentioned some of them, if you think about fixed wireless access, the majority of all new
customers are coming on the C-Band right now. That's a clear indication. Without the C-Band, we couldn't grow the broadband right now. We did
a history high of 1.4 billion net adds in the year of broadband subscribers. So of course, a lot have contributed to C-Band, and that's a clear metric
to have.

The other metrics you have is, of course, the unlimited premium, where we say that actually, we are performing very well, where we have deployed
the C-Band in order to get customers to step up. And the step-up is very important. We are in a multi-subscription business or we are in a subscription

business. And the more you can see that you're upgrading the price, the P on that quantity, it's enormously important for the long-term value for
our customers.

Other -- the third one that is coming and I mentioned also when I opened is, of course, private 5G networks, mobile edge compute. All that is, of
course, going to be very much supported by the C-Band as well. There, we will come back and start reporting on that when we feel that, that is
coming into the play from a more significant portion. But mobility -- and remember also that we have the wireless business side, the business side
actually growing because of the reliability of our network and the resilience of our network, which is how our enterprise customers are buying
from us when it comes to wireless business. So I think there are many metrics that you can see already now that is really connected to the C-Band.

Then I just want to remind you, it's almost less -- I think it's 1 year since we got -- since we launched the C-Band. It's only 1 year, and we're going to
cross 200 million POPs. We have never built so fast in the entire history of the company, and we're well ahead of the plan to hit the 250 million
POPs that we said at the Investor Day by end of '24. So I think that this is really a game changer in the market. And we see performance-wise, we're
outperforming. We have the most resilient 5G network in the nation, and we're just starting.

You're starting with 60 and 100 megahertz. And as you heard me talking, we have 160 in average. It's going to be 200 later on. It is a game changer,
and we can already see it right now. And we see already metrics right now that is proving it.

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson -- I'm sorry, Michael Rollins of Citibank.

Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & U.S. Telecoms Analyst

Two questions, if I could. The first one, as you mentioned earlier in the discussion that you pulled back from some of those longer-term targets that
you had, previously, you added the 3-plus percent service revenue and other growth for this year and 4-plus percent for next year, can you unpack
the categories that are at or above the plan from a few years ago? And then the areas of shortfall and if those areas, do you view those as temporary
or more permanent changes in the opportunity for Verizon?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Okay. I can start. I mean, first of all, we're more confident than ever that we have the right strategy and we have the 5 vectors of growth. All of them
are going along. Some are actually exceeding our expectations. Some are a little bit slower, and some have a little bit different jump-off points.
That's where we are. But there's no difference how we see the market and how we believe we can compete in all the 5 vectors of growth that we
outlined the last time. It's more a push in time than something else because of this year or this year, '22, I guess, I should say, had some jump-off
that is not really helping us.

But all in all, the whole strategy, where we're going, I have a lot of confidence in our team. The team has a lot of confidence, and we're executing.
We're eliminating the things that have been distracting us all the way from Verizon Media Group, et cetera.

Then we have some headwinds that we constantly work with as well that we don't talk so much about. On the wireline side, I talked about that
today. I mean, everything from the cost out, but not only that. We're going to be even more prudent what type of business we're taking, which will
reduce our top line probably. But it will improve our profitability and cash flow. So you're going to see us taking many actions to see that we are
delivering on the plans -- the long-term plans, but there are some shifts in it. Matt?

JANUARY 24, 2023 / 1:30PM, VZ.N - Q4 2022 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Mike, as you think about the conversation we had last year, and we talked about the long-term outlook, we provided the
piece parts, maybe if I go through some of those and where we are. Some of them were absolutely where we expected to be, think about nationwide
broadband with the year we had on FWA, but also Fios and the expectation to continue to see very good progress there. That's very much in line
with the expectations we outlined a year ago. Also, our business segment mobility results with 6 consecutive quarters above 150,000 net adds,
very much in line with the expectations that we had at the Investor Day.

A couple of areas where we are behind versus our expectation at that point in time. Firstly, you take one of them, the mobile edge compute and
5G private networks, you're talking about the technology adoption there on a new technology, that adoption curve, a little slower than maybe we
would have liked. But as you heard from Hans in the prepared remarks, heating up, we're starting to see some momentum there. So still feel good
about the opportunity there. But the pace of the adoption curve, a little different than we hoped it might be. But the upside there still looks very
good.

And then, of course, the other one, consumer mobility. At this time a year ago, we had higher expectations for '22 than where we ended up.
Obviously, a lot of that variance occurred in the first part of the year, and you saw the actions taken. But as you think about the piece parts of the
long-term outlook that we described a year ago and then how those have played out in the past 12 months, hopefully, that gives you a little more
color in terms of where things are moving along very much in line and where we also saw some areas where we've had to -- we have opportunity
to see further improvement as we go forward.

Operator

The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst

Sorry, I hope you can hear me. So Hans, I wonder if you could just talk a bit about your bundling strategy, particularly on the consumer side. With
both the strength now in fixed wireless but also Fios, is it your view that going forward, the consumer is going to buy wireless and wireline or fixed
access together? Or is that more of a sort of a financial bundling strategy rather than a real product bundling strategy?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Craig, no, I think it's a really good question. Of course, we have seen this as a very strong consumer movement in Europe that is, to a high degree,
have convergence in the U.S., where, I would say, much lower. But clearly, it is something that our customers are asking for. So it's actually a consumer
feedback. And I spent a lot of time in the stores, meeting a lot of our consumers. And they see a clear advantage to have the same provider on the
broadband as on the wireless. I don't think we will get into any European levels. But clearly, this is a movement, and Verizon has a super good
position here.

We have owners' economics on our broadband and on our wireless nationwide, both of them. And that's, of course -- we're going to meet the
customers here. If the customer thinks that is what they need, we're going to offer it, and that's why we have these bundles in the market. If they
want to have them separate, we can do that as well. We have owners' economics on both of them. But I think that trend will continue, given the
consumer research we are doing and the consumers we are talking to. That's something that is actually -- and it's not only consumers. You need
to think about small and medium business as well, make it convenient for them, both having the wireless and the broadband, because any SMB
today, and we spend -- we probably serve half of the SMBs in the country, any SMB today need a digital front door and then being mobile first. So
this is really good for us.

And if you look at our numbers this year on both on fixed wireless access and mobility in the business segment, SMB has been very important for
us. So yes, I think there's something in there definitely, and it's a consumer desire. And we're going to meet that desire as we continue.

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst

And are there big differences between the way you think about it in Fios versus non-Fios markets?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

No. It's not different. We see it in the same way if the customer -- of course, we're much more mature historically in the Fios footprint. On the other
side, when we do fixed wireless access, it's a much more natural discussion with the customer as we have it from the beginning. So I would say
that we probably have a big opportunity on the Fios segment to have customers both on the fixed and the mobile.

On the fixed wireless access, I think that there, you start actually on a strong position when you start offering fixed wireless access with many of
the customers sort of coming in either on a cable provider and have our wireless. And that's how they move over to us.

The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.

Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst

Hans, when we think about the balance between unit growth versus pricing, and obviously, you have made the deliberate choice not to chase unit
growth near term, but could you help us think through how you think about this longer term? Because once you cede market share, obviously, it
can be pretty expensive to get it back. And so when we think about this balance between pricing and unit growth, how important is unit growth
not just for short term as you look at 2023, but also longer term, especially when it comes to postpaid phone growth?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. No, good question. I think that as you heard us at least, I mean, we think that the profitable growth is the most important, both to have
the right customers retained with us and the ones we're getting. So that's an overarching measurement we need to have. Then, of course, it's always
going to be new customers that are important for our base.

But remember also, this market right now, if you talk about the premium segment, there are, of course, a certain amount of switchers in the market,
and then there are a certain amount of people going from pre to postpaid. There is no infusion of new customers in the system. So they're coming
from 2 sources, and you need to think about how you do that. And I think we have great opportunities right now with the TracFone brands we
have to see -- and Total wireless to see that we are taking care of that pre to post migration, which we've not been part of before. We still have
some work with the IT stacks and all of that. But clearly, today, we are running on both sides.

And on the switcher pool, yes, there, we're going to be seeing that we're prudent and disciplined, but we will go for the units we think are the right.
So -- but it's a subscription model long term that is even more important to increase the P sometimes than increasing the Q because this is long
term that you stay with the customers to get the long-term value from them. But it's a balance of it all the time and that we will continue to have.

Douglas Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD

You talked about amortization being up $1 billion for phone subsidies to catch up with cash spending. Embedded in all your guidance is cash
spending at peak levels. Is there a scope for it still to go higher? I know it depends on the competitive environment that it could eventually improve.
But are we at peak levels and it's just a question of amortization catching up?

And I'm curious, when you think about the service revenue guide for wireless, are there any price increases anticipated in that guide and kind of
what level of price increase? I know it's a sensitive topic, but just curious how we should think about that revenue growth.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Now if we talk about the price increases, I just want to come back to what I said before. I mean, we will be surgical and segmented in
our approach. There are certain segments we need to be more aggressive on. There might be areas where we see opportunities for price increases.
There are no major price increases included at this moment. We need to see where the market is going and also where cost levels are going, but
we will always look at that. But there's nothing right now that we have in our plans. Matt?

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the promotion piece, you've got the understanding of the accounting treatment versus the cash there, Doug. And certainly, our assumption
is that the marketplace will continue to be competitive, but we're not going to go into 100% details of what's in the guide there. But we do assume
that we'll continue to see competitive level in line with the past couple of years. And then as Hans said, we'll continue to look for ways to put plans
in the marketplace that reduce the level of subsidy out there as well, and we'll continue to push for those opportunities.

Operator

The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.

Tim Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst

Matt, can you talk about your goals for free cash flow? And specifically, how much do you think you can reduce the debt by -- per year kind of going
forward at this point?

And then secondly, can you talk about the gating factor for fixed wireless growth? It seems like you're implying with your '25 guidance that this is
kind of a good run rate, but yet your speeds are going to be increasing threefold and coverage, you're going to basically get a massive amount of
capacity kind of going out there. But do you think this is a good run rate for fixed wireless or can it accelerate?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

I can start with fixed wireless access. First of all, we just reiterated what we said in Investor Day, 4 million to 5 million subscribers on fixed wireless
access. Our job is always to try to beat that, but that was -- we just reiterated that, and we are well ahead on that plan.

Then the second is, of course, when it comes to our capacity, we have definitely capacity for that and much more. And again, we have a multi-usage
of our network. That has been sort of the basis for this, meaning the same radio base stations are serving mobility, fixed wireless access and mobile
edge compute. And we are not doing separate.

In the distant future, way above the 4 million and 5 million, we can always come into sort of decisions of splitting cells in order to get more fixed
wireless access. But that's very far away from now. We have ample capacity for the guide and much more than that. So -- and of course, our team
is doing everything to see that we can continue to exceed our targets.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Tim, on the free cash flow question, so absolutely, one of our goals is to continue to grow cash flow. Hans mentioned that you should measure us
on revenue growth, EBITDA growth and cash flow growth, and that cash flow growth is something we expect to be able to continue to generate
going forward. Obviously, the capital reduction from the high point in '22 to the guide we gave for this year and then an even lower amount next
year will be a positive towards that as we continue to obviously make progress on the income statement as well. You should see that contribute
there as well. So that puts us in a position where we can start to see accelerated levels of debt reduction versus what you've seen in the past year
or so. So that's the targets we have ahead of us and look forward to discussing progress against that as we go forward here.

The final question for today will come from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank.

Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Senior Analyst

I wanted to ask you about business postpaid phone net adds. They seem to be a bit lighter this quarter than they've been in the past 4 or 5 quarters.
And I'm just wondering if you're seeing trends there soften due to macroeconomic factors such as corporate staff reductions or if it's competitive
reasons. Or is it any slowdown in the secular trend toward company-issued devices? And then related to that, can you talk about what you're
assuming in the guidance at a high level for the macroeconomic environment? For example, are you assuming a soft landing scenario with small
macro impacts? Or are you baking in a more protracted downturn in the guidance?

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Yes. So it's a multifaceted question on the fourth quarter. Of course, on the business-to-business side, SMBs continue to be very strong.
And as I said, they need a digital storefront and a mobile-first strategy in today's world after COVID. So I think that's where we have been performing
very well. On the enterprise side, it's a little bit different, but we see that bring your own device is going down. And we see more companies saying
that they want the company phone, which is of course, helping us here. So -- and that we -- that trend we have seen for a couple of quarters. So I
think both of them are pretty solid.

On the consumer side, as I said, we had positive net adds. We had also, as I said before, a little bit spill over from the churn from the price increase
at the beginning of the quarter. And then there was actually fewer days of sales in the fourth quarter than in a normal quarter. So I don't think there
are any new things more than what I said. Customers were a little bit later in the holiday season to do. They had higher intent when it comes to
consumers, but it was nothing macroeconomical different than I talked about. Matt and I talked about the bad debt and the delinquency being
like pre-COVID or equal or better than pre-COVID. So no, there's nothing there. We are, of course, watching it. But so far, we continue to progress
well.

Matt Ellis - Verizon Communications Inc. - Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Just to add on a couple of points. So as you think about the VBG net adds, you're always going to see a little bit of volatility up and down from
1 quarter to the next just because of the size of some of the transactions there. So all in all, though, jobs numbers continue to be good. Business
numbers, good. Obviously, there's been some high-profile layoff announcements, but overall job numbers are good. And you see that show up in
the overall numbers that we produced throughout the year and look forward to continuing to have best-in-class market share within the Verizon
Business Group space as we go forward.

In terms of the macroeconomic assumptions in the guide, I wouldn't say we have anything too dissimilar to what you've heard from a number of
other people during earnings season. But one of the things I come back to is the resiliency of our customer base. We've been through different
types of economic environments in the past. We know customers pay their phone bills before they pay other bills and other outgoings. We fully
expect that to continue. And so we're obviously watching the macroeconomic environment. But as Hans said, the payment patterns continue to
be very strong, and we'll stay close to that. But so far, so good.
