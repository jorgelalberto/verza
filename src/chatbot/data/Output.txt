JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another
solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains
committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash
flow.

We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year
and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow
was $5.6 billion.

The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our
ability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband
and cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments.

Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to
the hard work and the dedication of our team.

Now let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation
and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade
levels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking
for ways to do better.

In May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns
with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped
our Verizon Consumer Group delivere notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving
higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving
our offerings to fit customers' needs.

We will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we
reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high
value they place on our services.

Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider
with elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We
are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.

Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular
decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating
the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.

On private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation
private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses,
and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.

The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our
broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable
broadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our
growth trajectory.

and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade
levels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking
for ways to do better.

In May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns
with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped
our Verizon Consumer Group delivere notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving
higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving
our offerings to fit customers' needs.

We will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we
reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high
value they place on our services.

Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider
with elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We
are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.

Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular
decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating
the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.

On private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation
private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses,
and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.

The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our
broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable
broadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our
growth trajectory.

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another
solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains
committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash
flow.

We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year
and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow
was $5.6 billion.

The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our
ability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband
and cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments.

Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to
the hard work and the dedication of our team.

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another
solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains
committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash
flow.

We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year
and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow
was $5.6 billion.

The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our
ability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband
and cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments.

Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to
the hard work and the dedication of our team.

Now let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation
and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade
levels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking
for ways to do better.

In May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns
with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped
our Verizon Consumer Group delivere notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving
higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving
our offerings to fit customers' needs.

We will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we
reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high
value they place on our services.

Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider
with elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We
are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.

Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular
decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating
the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.

On private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation
private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses,
and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.

The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our
broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable
broadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our
growth trajectory.

decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating
the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.

On private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation
private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses,
and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.

The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our
broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable
broadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our
growth trajectory.

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another
solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains
committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash
flow.

We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year
and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow
was $5.6 billion.

The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our
ability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband
and cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments.

Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to
the hard work and the dedication of our team.

Now let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation
and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade
levels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking
for ways to do better.

In May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns
with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped
our Verizon Consumer Group delivere notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving
higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving
our offerings to fit customers' needs.

We will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we
reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high
value they place on our services.

Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider
with elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We
are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.

Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular
decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another
solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains
committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash
flow.

We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year
and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow
was $5.6 billion.

The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our
ability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband
and cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments.

Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to
the hard work and the dedication of our team.

Now let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation
and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade
levels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking
for ways to do better.

In May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns
with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped
our Verizon Consumer Group delivere notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving
higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving
our offerings to fit customers' needs.

We will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we
reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high
value they place on our services.

Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider
with elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We
are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.

Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular
decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating
the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.

On private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation
private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses,
and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.

The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our
broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable
broadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our
growth trajectory.

JULY 25, 2023 / 12:30PM, VZ.N - Q2 2023 Verizon Communications Inc Earnings Call

Hans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another
solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains
committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash
flow.

We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year
and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow
was $5.6 billion.

The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our
ability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband
and cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments.

Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to
the hard work and the dedication of our team.

Now let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation
and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade
levels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking
for ways to do better.

In May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns
with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped
our Verizon Consumer Group delivere notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving
higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving
our offerings to fit customers' needs.

We will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we
reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high
value they place on our services.

Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider
with elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We
are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.

Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular
decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating
the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.

On private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation
private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses,
and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.

The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our
broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable
broadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our
growth trajectory.

Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to
the hard work and the dedication of our team.

Now let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation
and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade
levels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking
for ways to do better.

In May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns
with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped
our Verizon Consumer Group delivere notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving
higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving
our offerings to fit customers' needs.

We will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we
reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high
value they place on our services.

Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider
with elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We
are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.

Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular
decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating
the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.

On private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation
private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses,
and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.

The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our
broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable
broadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our
growth trajectory.

Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another
solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains
committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash
flow.

We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year
and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow
was $5.6 billion.

The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our
ability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband
and cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments.
