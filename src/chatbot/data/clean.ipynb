      "[\"\\nThis is all the time we have for questions today. Before we end the call, I want to turn it back over to Hans for a few closing comments.\\n\\nHans Vestberg - Verizon Communications Inc. - CEO\\n\\nThank you, Brad. And I'll just summarize up a little bit what we have been 'discussing. I mean, first of all, we have a strong financial operating\\nperformance in the fourth quarter, but not only that, the whole 2018. I think the wireless team has built the momentum all the way from Unlimited\\nlaunch. I have to say I'm proud of the team that continues to innovate and as Matt has said several times on this call, that gives us a very good start\\nfor 2019, what they have been doing so far this year.\\n\\nSo we are coming in with -- in 2019 with good momentum, both from a business point of view, but also our business excellence work we are\\ncontinuing to doing. And we are in the start of it. And I think that both Matt and I, we will do it in the best way and in a cautious way, but also\\nprepare ourselves for the future to be an even stronger company.\\n\\nI've outlined my 5 key priorities. You heard them, and I think that they should be resonated with all of you, both from the growth point of view,\\nimplementing the new structure, the 5G and, of course, our asset in our employees, and continue also to see that our brand evolves and that we're\\ndoing the right thing for our society. I think that goes for any company in today's world where employees, customers and shareholders are expecting\\nit from you. And I think that's our normal strategy. So it's nothing new, but it's more that we need to continue to leverage that in our humanability.\\n\\nWe will continue to focus on innovation and our network. There's no debate that, that is extremely important to us. And I'm proud of what the\\nteam did in the engineering in the network, on the 4G network. It continues to lead and extend the leadership, which I think is a great contribution\\nto the skill set we have in our technology group. And that, of course, continue in the 5G, which we have already our 5G Home commercial. We want\\nto see much more of 5G commercial, both Mobility and Home during 2019. And I hope that you are equally excited as I am, and I hope that you\\nwill join us for the Investor Day in February. We're going to bring the executive team there. You're going to meet the new leaders. We're going to\\ngo a little bit deeper on the things we're discussing today in the structure, what we're doing. And of course, we want to talk about 5G.\\n\\nSo with that, thank you for the time today, and great that you're listening. Thank you very much.\\n\\n\"]\n"
